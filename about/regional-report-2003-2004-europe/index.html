<h3 id="introduction"><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em></h3>
<p>The report that follows will begin with some observations on the
demographics of IASSIST European membership. I will then report on a few
of the many cross-national collaborations, after which will be
country-by-country reports of national/institutional/individual
activities. I have only included reports for those
people/organisations/countries/projects from whom I have received
information.</p>
<h3 id="european-membership"><em><strong>European membership</strong></em></h3>
<p>There are currently 49 IASSIST members from 13 countries &ldquo;on the
books&rdquo; for the European region (down from 53/21 last year). We
currently have no paid-up members from previously active countries:
France, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and
Slovenia. The decrease in European membership from 2001&rsquo;s high of 82
undoubtedly reflects the fact that the 2000/01 conference was held in
Amsterdam, and the subsequent two conferences in North America. The
geographic breakdown by sub-region across these to years is shown in the
tables below. The Anglo-Scandinavian domination continues, most likely
as a function of the fact that national funding for data service
activities (including travel to conferences and membership in relevant
organisations) is strongest in these countries. What is of concern to me
is the significant drop in percentage coming from Eastern Europe. I am
hopeful that this trend will reverse itself with the 2005 conference
coming to relatively more accessible Edinburgh. This may, however, also
be a reflection of the success of local networks such as EDAN, which
provide much closer to home some of the same kinds of training and
networking opportunities previously only available at IASSIST.</p>

The MADIERA project is now half way through and on course to developing
the tools and resources to produce an effective CESSDA gateway. Based on
stable NESSTAR products the MADIERA portal will utilise &ldquo;Google&rdquo; type
harvesting to incorporate the power of a multilingual thesaurus (ELSST)
in both searches and resource evaluation.</p>
<p>This new front end to the NESSTAR suite of products will in itself
become a standard product that can be used for other interoperability
projects. The major changes to existing software will be in the
publisher where allocation of terms from the thesaurus will be
semi-automated and common variables stored with their associated
keywords</p>
<p>The multilingual thesaurus now incorporates 8 European languages, namely
English, French, German, Spanish, Danish, Finnish, Greek and Norwegian.
It is hoped to double the number of concepts held in ELSST, to around
3,000, by the end of the project. Administrative procedures will also be
put in place to ensure that the development and maintenance of the
thesaurus continues beyond the end of the project.</p>

<p>Uwe Jensen writes:
The MetaDater project
(<a href="http://www.metadater.org" title="www.metadater.org">www.metadater.org</a>)
develops a Metadata Management and Production System for comparative
social surveys repeated over space and time. The objectives and expected
benefits of the project are to improve quality and richness of metadata
by developing system procedures and relational information structures
covering new exchange formats, standards and distributions platforms as
well. It aims to provide data analysts and researcher with highly
reliable and durable data and metadata documentation through the
development of tools for efficient and economic production and
management of those metadata by researchers (MD-COLL) and data services
(MD-PRO).</p>
<p><em>Progress against workpackages since January 2003:</em>
[WP2 - Analysis of Requirements &amp; User
Needs]{style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;}</p>
<p>The User analysis (WP2) refereed to the requirements and expectation to
a MetaDater system and covered two potential user groups: Data
Archivists and Researchers.</p>
<p><em>Data Archive Requirements &amp; Expectations</em>
The principal contractors of the consortium (DDA, EKKE, NIWI, SSD,
SIDOS, ZA) prepared substantial information on metadata processing and
management according to the partner&rsquo;s workflow. A general result was
that the implications of the technical and functional differences
between the existing systems and applications need deeper analytical
work at WP 3 (Modelling the Database) to achieve a unique conceptual
data model and WP4 (System Architecture) to judge the technical
requirements to be considered during the design of MD-PRO (WP5) and
MD-COLL (WP6).</p>
<p><em>Requirements &amp; Expectations of researcher at research and fieldwork
institutes</em>
The overall result of thirteen interviews on a metadata system covered
some concepts and specific ideas to improve metadata capture already in
the research phase. Broader attention was paid to facilities which
support questionnaire development or metadata capture on the study
design and the fieldwork. The project will consider to what extend these
expectations can be covered developing the MD-COLL tool designed to this
group of potential user.</p>
<p>[WP 3 - Modelling the Database]{style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;}
One central part of the project work in 2003 was to develop in WP3 a
substantial data model for metadata of the domain as the first product
of the project. As some of the most important entities (dataset, study
etc) are defined through specific scientific procedures the process
oriented perspective is of major importance in addition to the
data/metadata perspective itself. Overall user and system analysis and
data modelling are very closely related in this project. Although data
modelling is usually described by the development of an Entity
Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a Data Dictionary (DD), the detailed
analysis of essential processes and their preliminary specification are
also part of WP3. Based on the concepts of the &ldquo;Structured Analysis&rdquo;
the analysis covers two levels of abstraction, which makes no premature
decisions about how the domain will be implemented in the final system</p>
<ol>
<li>The essential model of the MetaDater system was modelled by
capturing and describing vital aspects of the domain in focus.
Taking the User Analysis (WP2) as the starting point general
conceptual requirements on data, metadata and processes were
analysed. This model is build by two sub models: the environmental
model and the behavioral model.</li>
<li>The conceptual data model for metadata, which is part of the
behavioral model, is described with two modelling tools: the entity
relationship diagram (ERD) and the data dictionary (DD).</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall the challenge of the metadata management and production system
is to make it possible to collect, manage and publish metadata within
the frame of a unique metadata model. The planned system has also to
meet the expectations of a wide variety of users and still has to
warrant compatibility. It has as well to take care of involved actors
and processes, which range from its collection and processing to
dissemination and long term preservation. The model aims to cover
metadata of most popular forms of multilingual survey designs.</p>
<p>The data model is compatible with the current standard of the DDI which
was taken as a reference. It is extended to cover arising needs on
adequate descriptions of time series survey data and international
comparative studies. A specific intention of MetaDater project is to
support the development of the DDI standard providing the conceptual
metadata model to selected expert groups from DDI, CESSDA and other
interested groups. After internal specification of some of the basic
concepts a first draft will be made available to interested expert
outside the project according to the following planned time schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mid June: Presentation of the data model concept to Tom Piazza in
Cologne</li>
<li>July: Providing a 1st. draft to experts at DDI, CESSDA and
researchers e.g. CSDI</li>
<li>Autumn 2004: European expert meeting - Participation in DDI expert
meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results will be the base of the programming phase for MD-PRO (WP5)
and MD-COLL (WP6) as the major work in the second half of 2004.</p>

<p>CESSDA is currently working on revising its transborder data exchange
agreement, and has set up a working group to propose a new model. The
group&rsquo;s work will be reported on at this year&rsquo;s IASSIST conference.</p>
<p>[Expert Seminar]{style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;}
The CESSDA expert seminar took place in Vienna hosted by WISDOM on 21-22
September 2003 and focused on &ldquo;Data Service Cost Structures and User
Needs: From Economic Aspects to Authentication Practices at CESSDA
Archives.&rdquo; Included were sessions on steps towards a new transborder
agreement: fee structures, user groups, dataset types, registration and
authentication procedures; and the Future of Data Processing.</p>
<p>The 2004 seminar will be in Neuchâtel, Switzerland 9-11 September,
hosted by SIDOS, and will concern Dataset Processing and Publishing.</p>

[EDAN Training Seminar]{style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;}
The second training seminar of the East European Data Archive Network
(EDAN) will be held at the University of Ljubljana (Slovenia) on 4-6
June 2004. It is intended for DDI Beginners and covers the basics of
producing DDI compliant codebooks. This seminar will introduce the
structure of the DDI metadata format and demonstrate how to produce DDI
compliant codebooks. Based on the ADP&rsquo;s experience with creating
DDI-XML codebooks the participants will learn in a hands-on exercise how
to get the most out of the Tag Library as well as making full use of
elements and attributes. By sharing the manuals and tools for creating
codebooks ADP would like to launch a discussion on Best practices in
meta data production.</p>
<p><strong>ERPANET / CODATA Workshop</strong>
[The Selection, Appraisal and Retention of Digital Scientific
Data]{style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;}
Excerpt from the final report Executive Summary :
The international EPRANET/CODATA seminar examined the current state of
practice of the selection, appraisal and retention among diverse
scientific communities and discussed how archival concepts can best be
applied to the management and long-term preservation of digital data.
The seminar was held 15th - 17th December 2003 at the Biblioteca
Nacional in Lisbon, and brought together more than sixty-five
researchers, data managers, information specialists, archivists, and
librarians from thirteen countries to discuss the issues involved in
making critical decisions regarding the long-term preservation of the
scientific record. One of the major aims for this seminar was to provide
an international forum to exchange information about data archiving
policies and practices across different scientific, institutional, and
national contexts. The seminar proved to be extremely successful in
enabling discussions between scientific and archival communities. The
seminar also highlighted some conceptual hurdles to overcome before
effective collaboration between the diverse communities can take place.</p>

In terms of user statistics and the progress of the major projects, the
year 2003 was successful for FSD.</p>
<p>FSD&rsquo;s Board and National Advisory Committee accepted a new
organisational structure for the archive in the spring of 2003. It was
implemented in the beginning of 2004. The new structure defines more
clearly who has responsibility for data localisation and acquisition,
user services and data documentation, and PR &amp; information &amp; networking
activities.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2004, FSD launched a three-year project which aims
at creating learning materials to support social science research and
methodology teaching. See more at
<a href="http://www.fsd.uta.fi/tietoarkistolehti/english/13/oppimateriaali.htmll">http://www.fsd.uta.fi/tietoarkistolehti/english/13/oppimateriaali.html</a>.</p>
<p>FSD began archiving qualitative data in 2003. The main challenges have
been to develop anonymisation strategies, convert paper-based datasets
into electronic text files, and process large open-ended Internet
surveys into re-usable semi-structured datasets. XML coding was used
successfully in the data processing.</p>
<p>The Finnish Information Centre for Register Research (ReTki) was set up
in August 2003, and is part of the Finnish National Research and
Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES) in Helsinki. The
centre focuses on facilitating register-based research in Finland,
especially in social and health sciences. It also offers advice on how
to plan and carry out research based on register information and on
statistic reports. FSD co-operates with this new unit.</p>

In 2002 the Royal Academy of Sciences decided to dissolve NIWI, where
the Steinmetz data archive is located. Next a series of commissions
started to give advise on the future of NIWI and the future of data
infrastructure for the Social Sciences.</p>
<p>Their advice of the first commission (in September 2003) pointed towards
a solution in which Steinmetz Archive and the Historical Data Archive
would merge, and the Research Council&rsquo;s Statistical Agency would stay
at the council. This would imply missing the opportunity to merge the
Scientific Agency, the Steinmetz, and the Historical Data Archive into
ONE strong and substantial office. Fortunately the Royal Academy decided
in December 2003 to go this way. But this meant that a lot of advisory
work had to be redone. It was decided (in Feb 2004) by both the Research
Council and the Royal Academy to go for one new institute: DANS (Data
Archiving and Networked Services). A Strategic Workforce has been
appointed and 2 leading scientists (and a professional secretary) will
produce a blueprint for the new organization. Decisions are expected
during the summer. The new organization would start as of January 2005.</p>
<p>The Scientific Statistical Agency has an English version catalogue
interface at <a href="http://www.dataneth.nl">http://www.dataneth.nl</a>. Foreign researchers can order
data (although it is not the researcher but the university that has to
order the data).</p>

After a decision in the Parliament in 2002, ownership was moved from the
Research Council to the Ministry of Education and Research. In January
2003 NSD was established as a company 100 % owned by the Ministry.</p>
<p>The reason for the change was a wish from all parties involved to give
NSD a higher degree of freedom. NSD will still receive its basic funding
for the Research Council and the NSD Board will still be elected from
the same constituency (mainly social sciences and medicine as well as
Statistics Norway).</p>
<p>NSD&rsquo;s agreements with Statistics Norway, the Data Inspectorate, the

In the last 6 months, RODA has been working on a Visual Access Control
Unit as an add-on to the Nesstar system. Our (beta version) module is
based on MySQL, Apache and Tomcat servers, and is capable of reading the
published XML file with data and metadata from the Nesstar server,
translates this to MySQL then print it to the webpage under a specified
format (using PHP and Java Scripts). The administrator can: validate
users, set various rights for users and visually set access control
rules (using combo boxes with MySQL table headers). The module is
completely secure, using a 128bits encryption key for usernames and
passwords. As soon as we finish documenting it, we can release a working
version to the community.</p>

<p>In November 2003, the Integrated Sociological Data Archive conducted an
annual seminar. Researchers and academics from Moscow and a number of
regions, including Yekaterinburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Magadan, Ufa, Kazan,
Biysk, Barnaul, Ulyanovsk, Samara and Vladikavkaz attended the seminar.
On the first day, the seminar participants were informed about the
network that encompasses sociological data archives as well as a
particular contribution of the Russian Sociological Data Archive. They
also learned how to use the retrieval system, and obtained data they
required for their research. The second day of the seminar was devoted
to principal analytical skills one should have to handle sociological
data. You can find more information at

2003 at the SIDOS</p>
<p>Last year could appear as a &ldquo;normal year&rdquo; for the SIDOS : we have
complemented the datasets at disposal by adding some very interesting
pieces and the distribution of the Swiss datasets is still in growth. In
the same direction, we can mention an augmentation of 30% for the number
of web pages asked by the users. A more complete file that documents 10
years of activities and the progress realised during this time is at
disposal on the web site. Nevertheless some other points seem important
to mention.</p>
<p>First, I have to stress the collaboration in the CESDDA and the work
done around the Metadater and Madiera projects. In some sense it is a
first step to-ward a major change in the work of the archives, which
will be more and more part of an international network, a part of an
emerging European Research Area.</p>
<p>Second I have to mention the Swiss participation to the international
surveys, ISSP and ESS in particular, where SIDOS is responsible for.
This is important for an archive in the Swiss context for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>to learn the problems linked to the production of quality data;</li>
<li>to better the image of the archive in the researcher&rsquo;s community by
giving quickly access to important data;</li>
<li>to stress that, for these programs, the concept of infrastructure
for the social sciences was introduced in a special section of the
Swiss national science foundation, giving more visibility and
acknowledgement to this kind of activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Third, 2003 was the year of introduction of a Nesstar server at the
SIDOS. This point is certainly the example of new ways to service the
users, with more interactivity, but is also the occasion to rethink the
documentation and, in particular, to give more visibility to the
complete formulation of the questions and not only the summary
habitually furnished with the datasets. It is also the occasion the
rethink the category of users and the way to give them access rights
ac-cording their institutional situation for some datasets.</p>

Within the &ldquo;Center Social Indicators&rdquo; the Project of the Open Bank of
Social Data (DATABANK) initiates the creation of the National Bank of
Social Data. The main purpose of this project is to promote free access
to data of sociological surveys about Ukrainian society in the process
of transition. The following partners are co-operating in the project:
Kiev International Institute of Sociology, the Sociological Department
of the National University of Kiev-Mohyla Academy, Donetsk
Information-Analytical Centre, Institute of Sociology of the National
Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, T. Shevchenko Kyiv State University. It
is expected that the completion of the DATABANK with new sociological
survey data will be persistent and will not stop at this stage but will
continue in the course of its existence.</p>

The EDINA National Datacentre and Edinburgh University Data Library
became a planning unit in the University&rsquo;s Information Services Group,
no longer a division in the Computing Service. EDINA added the
Educational Image Gallery to its suite of multimedia content services,
updated its UKBORDERS boundary data service with 2001 data, and became
further involved with a number of technical development projects, from
geographic metadata to middleware infrastructure services. It hosted its
first EDINA Exchange public event in May, showcasing its projects and
services for site representatives at the National e-Science Centre in
Edinburgh. (<a href="http://edina.ac.uk/">edina.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<p>EDINA also participated in a consortium bid to host a UK Digital
Curation Centre and is now involved in the management of the set-up
phase as well as hosting a website and helpdesk for the Centre. The DCC
intends to support expertise and practice in data curation and
preservation, prompting collaboration between the Universities and the
Research Councils to ensure that there is continuing access to data of
scholarly interest. The initial focus is on research data, but the
policy intention is to also address the preservation needs of e-learning
and scholarly communication. (<a href="www.dcc.ac.uk">www.dcc.ac.uk</a>)</p>
<p>A group of university-based data librarians and data managers have come
together to form a support group - DISC-UK, or Data Information

year to compare issues and solutions in their daily work, and met for
the first time at the London School of Economics in February, this year.
The founding members - six data professionals from Oxford, Edinburgh,
and LSE - intend to open up their group to others performing similar
roles in their universities, such as national data service site
representatives - though they may not work in dedicated data libraries.

<p>[ESDS]{style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;}</p>
<p>Kevin Schürer writes:
The initial period of the new Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS -
established in January 2003) was hectic but exciting. Clearly, three key
objectives in the initial period were to establish effective
communication between the separate units of the distributed service (two
at University of Essex and two at University of Manchester); to
establish an identity for the new service; and at the same to continue
service the user community.</p>
<p>Whilst services to users continued uninterrupted from January, the new
service was formally launched on 30 June 2003 at an event held at
Regent&rsquo;s College, London, at which various new products were
demonstrated and Ian Diamond (Chief Executive, Economic and Social
Research Council) and Len Cook (the National Statistician) gave
addresses. This meeting also provided the opportunity for the first
meeting of the ESDS Advisory Committee to take place, under the
chairmanship of John Pullinger (Office for National Statistics).</p>
<p>The new ESDS website went live and has been continuously populated with
new content reflecting the four new value-added subject-oriented
services, in addition to the core Access and Preservation and Management
services, which make up ESDS. The new online data delivery system for
international macrodata using Beyond 20/20 went live in April 2003. A
new Athens-based registration service for ESDS International was
developed, tested and was launched in June 2003, in order to augment the
web-based Beyond 20/20 delivery system and the NS Times Series Databank.
This will provide the basis of the service-wide one-stop registration
system to be implemented in June 2004.</p>
<p>In order to promote and raise user awareness about the new service a lot
of effort was placed on organising and contributing to a number of
meetings, training events; seminars and workshops. While some of these
events, due to the audience in question, focused on one or other of the
specialist services of ESDS, all provided general contextual information
on ESDS and its component services.</p>
<p>Over the third quarter a large amount of work took place on internal
systems development, building the ESDS administrative back-end. This is
largely invisible to the outside world, yet is critical to the smooth
functioning of the service. An overview of these developments is
summarised at follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete re-vamping of the process by which users register, order
data, and are charged is underway, together with a complete
restructuring of the central user and order database. New system to
be launched end June 2004.</li>
<li>New procedures regarding the acquisition process are well advanced,
with new interactive deposit forms, new depositor licence, new
back-end database for depositors and acquisitions negotiations.</li>
<li>A new suite of input programs for the new catalogue have been
implemented and new cataloguing QA procedures have been put in
place. These will greatly speed and improve quality of cataloguing.</li>
<li>Development of a new data processing tracking database, which will
directly feed the UKDA-produced metadata (catalogue metadata, read
files, citation and title page information).</li>
<li>Automation work was undertaken to speed, smooth, and standardise the
preparation of datasets in multiple software formats for http
download.</li>
<li>Work is being done on access control will allow more users to access
more datasets via http download (i.e. &ldquo;depositor permission&rdquo;
datasets will be able to be mounted, non-academic users will be able
to use download if access conditions permit, etc).</li>
<li>Work is being done on Athens implementation, and on becoming an
Athens issuing agent for users outside UK HE/FE who can&rsquo;t obtain
Athens IDs through their home institution, and on implementing
Athens in Nesstar access control.</li>
<li>SLD (Service Level Definition) has finally been agreed at
videoconference on 22 October. Rationalised and streamlined
reporting template will make quarterly reporting against target
performance indicators more straightforward.</li>
<li>ESDS International have been successful in negotiating draft
licences with the UN for the UN Common Database, with World Bank for
the World Development Indicators and Global Development Finance data
and with the ILO for the Key Indicators of the Labour Market data
series. OECD have also agreed to increase the number of data cells
that can be extracted via the Beyond 20/20 WDS to 50,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another strand of ESDS activity that we would wish to highlight is the
continued acquisition of new data collections. Since the establishment
of ESDS in addition to &lsquo;core&rsquo; and longitudinal data materials the ESDS
Access and Preservation has acquired a total of 63 government datasets
(excluding new editions). This figure is 80 per cent in excess of the
originally set target. Equally, the ESDS International data portfolio
has expanded considerably in the last quarter with the addition of a
number of key international macro databanks.</p>
<p>Lastly, another highlight in this period has been the development by
ESDS International (hosted at MIMAS, University of Manchester) of an
interactive web-based data exploration and visualisation interface to a
set of key international statistics. CommonGIS, a web-based Geographical
Information System (GIS), has been used to provide a pilot interface to
the freely available CIA World Factbook 2002 socio-economic data. During
2004 this value-added service will be enhanced to provide users the
chance to explore and view themed datasets from the ESDS International
data portfolio using the interactive web GIS.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2003, ESDS had approximately 2,000 distinct users,
who collectively accessed approximately 17,000 data collections.</p>
