<h3 id="5-reports-of-the-regional-secretariats">5. Reports of the Regional Secretariats</h3>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> Australia - Roger Jones</p>
<p>Roger Jones is the longest running IASSIST regional secretariat.
Membership in Australia has increased by 50% in the past year, and 50%
of the membership are present at this IASSIST conference.</p>
<p>A data archive, the New Zealand Social Research Data Archives (NZSDA) is
being established at Massey University. Main problems are developing
outreach to other parts of the region. With the creation of the
Australian Association of Social Researchers created in the past year,
Jones predicts more interest developing in associations such as IASSIST.</p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong> Canada - Wendy Watkins</p>
<p>Given tight budgets, 1992-93 has been a very creative year for Canadian
IASSISTers! Several universities have banded together for group
purchases, group subscriptions, sharing training resources and other
co-operative ventures.</p>
<p>Thirteen western universities, the entire membership of the Council of
prairie and Pacific University Libraries (COPPUL) voted unanimously to
form a federated membership in ICPSR. Similar arrangements are being
negotiated with OCUL and CREPUQ representing university libraries in
Ontario and Quebec respectively.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the COPPUL-ICPSR federation proposal, the
Universities of Alberta and British Columbia along with Simon Fraser
University jointly offered a data library workshop in Calgary.</p>
<p>In the realm of distributed and network service, the University of
Alberta is now supporting its own gopher server. At Simon Fraser, the
Research Data Library is on the university&rsquo;s Campus-Wide Information
Service (CWIS) and has set up a CANSIM server which is distributed to
UBC and the University of Alberta, with Statistics Canada&rsquo;s hearty
endorsement.</p>
<p>Further to the east, Statistics Canada&rsquo;s Quebec regional office offered
two, one-day workshops to librarians using their CANSIM and Census cd
data products. A workshop for &lsquo;upcoming data librarians&rsquo; was held in
Quebec in April.</p>
<p>The year has seen three established data archives change places of
residence or responsibility. Both the University of British Columbia and
the University of Alberta libraries have taken responsibility for the
data libraries from the computing centres. In addition, Carleton&rsquo;s
Social Science Data Archives has been moved from the Sociology
Department and is now known as the Library Data Centre. Again,
responsibility resides in the Library.</p>
<p>While some of the &lsquo;old&rsquo; archives were on the move, new data libraries
were established at the University of Calgary, the University of
Saskatchewan and Universite Laval. In addition, the libraries at McGill,
Guelph, and Waterloo are thinking about consolidating, coordinating
and/or assuming responsibility for the existing data services.</p>
<p>The Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) organized two
further group purchases of data, this time for the 1991 Census of
population and the 1991 Census of agriculture. This brings the number of
consortium bulk purchases to five. Previous acquisitions included two
sets of GSS (General Social Survey) data and the data from the 1986
Census of population.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada&rsquo;s University Liaison Program is now in its third
year. This year, a member of the Headquarters staff is in residence in
the Faculty of Education at Queen&rsquo;s University. In addition, the
Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal Regional Offices have collaborated with
universities in their areas.</p>
<p>In December [1992], the Canadian Library Association and the federal
Department of Communications held a National Information Summit, with
200 invited delegates. IASSIST was well-represented, under the guise of
different institutions. For example, Laine Ruus attended as co-chair of
the Canadian Global Change Data and Information Systems Panel, and Ernie
Boyko attended as chair of the West Quebec School Board&rsquo;s Information
Technology Committee. A report from the summit is expected any day now
and can be made available to anyone who is interested.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada and the Depository Services Program launched a pilot
project which saw a limited number of electronic products from the 1991
Census of population distributed to libraries. While reports are just
now coming in, preliminary evaluations suggest that libraries are quite
willing to receive these products, provided they contain more detailed
material than can be found in printed products.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, two Freenets or community computing facilities were
established over the past year. The first, in Victoria, was instituted
in late 1992, and has more than 1,000 registered users, while the
National Capital Freenet was launched in Ottawa in February of this
year. It is now the second biggest in North America, with more than
4,000 registered users.</p>
<p>Not to be left behind, a group of committed people is currently planning
the Toronto Free-Net. After several planning sessions, their held their
first meeting in late April and had to turn people away at the door. And
a Vancouver Freenet plans to be in operation by the end of the year.
We&rsquo;d all like to hear from the rest of you about community computing in
your area. Perhaps we could make it into a session next year.</p>
<p>Thus the theme for the year is sharing our wealth of experience, forming
alliances and stretching scarce resources in altogether new ways.</p>
<p><strong>5.3</strong> Europe - Peter Burnhill</p>
<p>Burnhill and Karsten Boye Rasmussen have been concentrating on growth of
IASSIST in Europe, through efforts such as this conference, and a 3-day
seminar held in September of 1992 in collaboration with the Library
Association and Census. IASSIST members Diane Geraci, Carolyn Geda, and
Karsten Boye Rasmussen participated in the September meeting.</p>
<p>Are proposing periodic IASSIST regional meetings in Europe, not to be
held in May, so as not to conflict with the IASSIST annual conference.
The next such regional meeting may be in September of 1994, at a
location to be determined.</p>
<p>Rasmussen, Vigdis Kvalheim, and Burnhill will also be working to promote
IASSIST membership among staff of IFDO institutions.</p>
<p><strong>5.4</strong> United States - Anne Gray</p>
<p>Reported on the current status of the Don Harrison resolution re the
fate of archival materials relating to Vietnam war veterans, which has
now been reviewed by Judith Rowe and AG. CD-ROM products of 1990 Census
data are being disseminated through the US Depository Services Program.
These products are massive - a new one is coming which will consist of
45 CD-ROMs.</p>
<p>IASSIST members have been very active in participating in a number of
associations, teaching, and other outreach activities, such as the
workshops on archiving of electronic records being conducted by Peggy
Adams and Mark Conrad.</p>
<h3 id="6-reports-of-the-round-tables">6. Reports of the Round Tables</h3>
<p><strong>6.1</strong> Round table on the virtual data library - Judith Rowe</p>
<p>Participants were unable to agree on the meaning of &lsquo;virtual archive&rsquo;.
A number of concerns were discussed, including access versus ownership,
the need for special expertise to make data available to users. In the
U.S., there is considerable concern with federal government agencies
assuming responsibility for archiving their own data. Further discussion
ranged over centralized data catalogues, relationships with ICPSR,
putting data on-line for wider access, and access to information about
data.</p>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> Round table on documentation at the variable level (i.e. codebooks) - Karsten Rasmussen</p>
<p>Although the table was a square one, there was consensus, partly based
on all the papers during the conference, on software and dreams, that we
are approaching a &lsquo;standardized dream&rsquo;. Rasmussen proposes that a
working group be set up to identify features that should be available in
social science codebooks&hellip;the keyword in the new codebook vision is
flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong> Round table on &lsquo;liberating the data&rsquo; - Ernie Boyko</p>
<p>The participants discussed whether or not data are as free as they might
be. It was decided that the Norwegian policy towards data was the most
liberated of those represented at the table : the Norwegian statistical
office deposits data with the Norwegian Social Science Data Archive,
which is mandated to support research. In the United Kingdom, the 1991
census of population represented an exception in that ESRC paid for the
machine-readable products; otherwise, all data sets produced by the
government are deposited in the ESRC Data Archive, which makes them
available to researchers. In Canada, it has been necessary to resort to
buying-consortia in order to gain access to expensive data files. In
Australia too, there is a current effort to negotiate to buy census
data. Participants were in agreement that charging for data impedes
their use in the generation of knowledge.</p>
<p>The quote of the conference: &ldquo;You have to love us for something other
than money, because that is not our strength.&rdquo; - Peter Burnhill.</p>
<p>Denise Lievesley&rsquo;s 10 services that data libraries provide to data
producers:</p>
<ul>
<li>long-term preservation</li>
<li>augmented documentation</li>
<li>user support</li>
<li>a safety net re personally identifiable information</li>
<li>data access to data producers themselves</li>
<li>promote the use of data</li>
<li>educate users in the ethical use of data</li>
<li>act as an intermediary between data producers and data users</li>
<li>provide feedback to producers</li>
<li>train &lsquo;baby statisticians&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Judith Rowe rejoindered that the report did not take the U.S. situation
into account. The U.S. situation of having all federal government
information in the public domain is a very important distinction. Boyko
replied that no Americans had participated in the round table.</p>
<p><strong>6.4</strong> Round table on creating documentation guidelines for data producers - Bridget Winstanley</p>
<p>This round table had a very wide international representation, with the
exception of Australia. It was felt that new guidelines are needed which
are targeted at the data producers - n.b. these should be guidelines
rather than standards&hellip;it is probably not possible to impose standards
at this stage. The guidelines should be applicable to more than just
social science files, i.e. also text files. They should also be as
generic as possible, and contain references to further information.
Discussion of how to persuade producers to follow the guidelines
included such possibilities as funding sanctions, incentives such as
citations, and making it easy to produce documentation, e.g. through the
data capture system. Mention was made of the TEI initiative as a
laudable example of promoting guidelines. Importance of having
internationally accepted guidelines, especially with the increasing
importance of cross-national research. Discussions also covered such
facets as vocabulary, e.g. metadata, technical reports, user guides -
definitions that can be internationally accepted.</p>
<p><strong>6.5</strong> The nameless round table - Peter Burnhill</p>
<p>This was a &lsquo;real&rsquo; round table. Discussion concentrated on the
Internet. From this round table comes a recommendation that there should
be a &lsquo;flotsam &amp; jetsam&rsquo; round table with no assigned discussion topic

<h3 id="7-proposed-working-groups">7. Proposed working groups</h3>
<p>The following proposals for working groups were presented:</p>
<p><strong>7.1</strong> Conference planning manual</p>
<p>Proposal to form a Working Group on a conference planning manual for
IASSIST
Co-chairs: Gaetan Drolet and Laura Guy</p>
<p>Objectives: to write a conference planning manual for IASSIST to be made
available through the IASSIST listserv. Also to plan and gather, and
make available through an appropriate site, software to facilitate
registration, etc. Also to make recommendations for future revision and
updating of the manual.</p>
<p>Membership: interested members of IASSIST, especially previous
conference local arrangements and program chairs, to be appointed by the
co-chairs.</p>
<p>Time span: to report with a final draft of the manual to the 1994
meeting of the Administrative Committee.</p>
<p><strong>7.2</strong> Codebook Documentation of Social Science Data Working Group Chair - Karsten Boye Rasmussen</p>
<p>The last years there has been some confusion concerning who are making
what changes to the OSIRIS-codebook. The OSIRIS codebook format has for
more than twenty years been the de-facto standard for archives around
the world. The most obvious reasons for this standard are that the
OSIRIS codebooks can store full text, are input to retrieval systems,
and that the codebooks are easily converted to other formats (SAS and
SPSS). I propose that the task of this working group is to make
clarification on this confusion by:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Identifying the tasks and areas that cannot be solved by the
OSIRIS codebook in its present form. Two examples: A) Many archives are
looking for a feature of presenting tabulations in the codebooks - not
just frequencies. B) A less rigid print out of codebooks not limited by
the original card image input format. It is important to note that the
first is a problem of storing new information in the codebooks. The
second concerns the utilisation of the codebook, and could be changed
without changing the codebook format (by flowing the text, and using a
different font).</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Identifying the number of data sets at archives all over the
world. The data sets should be grouped by the level of documentation: A)
full text machine readable codebooks (what format?); B) abbreviated
machine readable documentation (OSIRIS dictionary / SAS / SPSS ?); C) no
machine readable documentation (paper / scanned information). Data sets
that are originally stored at other archives (ICPSR etc.) are to be
counted only at the original archive. Another question would be whether
the archive is producing machine readable documentation at all.</p>
<p>The rationale behind the second identification is that archives that
have produced and stored machine readable documentation (e.g. OSIRIS
codebooks) will be able to convert these to the new format (missing the
special features of the new format). There will not be invented a new
codebook format, that automatically documents what has not been
documented. The archives having documented in the same way will be able
to use the same software for making the conversion to the new format.</p>

conference in Edinburgh. May 13, 1993.</p>
<p><strong>7.3</strong> Creating documentation guidelines for data producers Chairs - Sue Dodd, Bridget Winstanley</p>
<p>Objectives: The primary goal is to draft an IASSIST Manual for
Documenting Social Science Data which would include a set of descriptive
elements necessary to describe and use the data.</p>
<p>A secondary goal would be to inform appropriate social science funding
agencies about the Manual and its contents. In addition to requiring
that recipients of social science funding deposit their data in an
archive of choice, the funding agencies would be persuaded to extend
this requirement to include the generation of acceptable documentation
as part of the data creation process &ndash; using the Manual and subsequent
elements as a guide. The funding agencies would make it clear that the
initial and final responsibility for creating useable documentation
would lie with the principal investigator(s). The manual would outline
minimal and optimal elements &ndash; giving the principal investigators a
choice.</p>
<p><strong>7.4</strong> Bibliographic standards: Chair - Patricia Vanderberg</p>
<p>I propose that IASSIST establish a cataloguing working group to review
cataloguing rules and documents that have relevance for cataloguing
research data. Such a working group would produce a written document
with recommendations for changes to the <em>Anglo-American cataloguing
rules</em>, 2nd revised edition, that would reflect changes in both
technological developments and access needs. This body would carry on
the work of the former IASSIST Classification Action Group and would
assist the IASSIST representative to the American Library Association,
Committee on Cataloguing, Description and Access maintain our
perspective and visibility in the international cataloguing arena.
Current documents needing review are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guidelines for description of Internet resources.</li>
<li>CC:DA/MARBI/9 Proposal 93-4: Changes to the US MARC bibliographic
format (computer files) to accommodate on-line information
resources.</li>
<li>Guidelines for bibliographic description of interactive media.</li>
<li>Guidelines for bibliographic description of reproductions.</li>
<li>as well as others yet to come.</li>
</ol>
<p>I recommend that the timetable for this work be 2 years and I assume my
commitment to chair such a body and bring its work to logical conclusion
within this 2 year period.</p>
