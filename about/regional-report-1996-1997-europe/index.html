<dt><strong>Per Nielsen</strong></dt>
<dd>The European Region and IASSIST as a whole are the poorer for the
loss of Per Nielsen. His untimely death on December 27 1996 has
deeply saddened us all.</dd>
</dl>
<!-- -->
<dl>
<dt><strong>Introduction</strong></dt>
<dd>The news items recorded below show some of the activities in the
European region which involve IASSIST members. I know that there are
very many more, but the deadline has come and gone, so this must be
posted! I am sure that I shall have more to add when I present my
verbal report at Odense in May.</dd>

<dt><strong>The ILSES project</strong></dt>
<dd>(Information supplied by Repke de Vries)</dd>
<dd>A group of Dutch, German, French and Irish institutes has been
successful in obtaining funding from the European Commission under
the 4th Framework for a project which will provide access to
documentary information and empirical data related to large-scale
surveys such as the binannual Eurobarometer surveys. ILSES is
designed to serve both end-users and content-providers of
socio-economic information.</dd>
<dd>ILSES allows end-users to extend literature searches to access to
empirical data. This allows them to extend classic literature
research with their own original empirical analyses of relevant
data. ILSES of course also offers the other route: directing
data-analysts searching for specific empirical data to be used in
secondary analysis to literature in which results and outcomes of
previous and similar analyses have been reported.</dd>
<dd>For content-providers ILSES offers tools and procedures for the
normalization, cataloguing and controlled distribution of
(distributed) holdings of the documentary and data resources
mentioned above. Such content-providers are the database
administration staffs of libraries and data archives. ILSES will
enable them to drastically increase and improve the utilization of
their information resources while at the same time reducing their
support burden per information request or retrieval.</dd>
<dd>ILSES will be designed as an open system which can be applied to
different kinds of library and data holdings. In this project,
however, a pilot-application will be focused on socio-economic
information as collected by large scale surveys, and on the
associated literature.</dd>
<dd>ILSES is based on integrated relational databases of
meta-information pertaining to both library and data-archive
holdings, both of which are typically distributed over many
different institutions.</dd>

<dt><strong>The NESSTAR Project (Networked European Social Science Tools and Resources)</strong></dt>
<dd>The NESSTAR project is utilising recent advances in Internet
technology to meet the increasing demand for European data. The
project has spent 12 months as a &ldquo;Preliminary Pilot Project,&rdquo;
funded by the European Union. This time was spent evaluating
available technologies, identifying user requirements and developing
a functional specification, a blue print for the final system. The
original partners, The Data Archive, Norwegian Social Science Data
Services and the Danish Data Archive have now been joined by the
Irish Central Statistics Office, The Norwegian Institute of
Journalism, The University of Aarhus in Denmark, Anàlisis
Sociológicos Económicos y Politicos and JD Systems, both of Madrid.
These partners have submitted a new proposal to the EU. If
successful the partners will spend the next two years building a web
based system to provide online facilities to:
<ol>
<li>locate data sources and browse metadata</li>
<li>browse, analyse and visualise data and documentation</li>
<li>deliver data and documentation (including subsets) in a variety
of formats</li>
<li>encourage feedback from, and communication between users</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>NESSTAR will lower technical barriers to data allowing users with
few computing and statistical skills to access these valuable
sources of information. It will also facilitate cross-national
research. Further information about the project can be found at the
project&rsquo;s website, <a href="http://dawww.essex.ac.uk/projects/nesstar">http://dawww.essex.ac.uk/projects/nesstar</a>. Any
questions or comments about the project should be directed to Simon
Musgrave or Michelle Rogerson.</p>

<dt><strong>News from Ireland</strong></dt>
<dd>Ken Hannigan has supplied the following information:</dd>
<dd>Because Ireland held the Presidency of the EU last year Ireland was
able in October to host a meeting of European experts on electronic
records as part of the programme of cultural events under the
Presidency. It included a half-day seminar for Irish archivists on
the subject of electronic records and the launch of &ldquo;For the
Record&rdquo;, the proceedings of the previous year&rsquo;s conference on data
archives, electronic records and access to information to which
Denise Lievesley and Mark Conrad contributed (and which Mark
co-edited). This was the first Irish publication devoted to the
theme of electronic records and data archives.</dd>
<dd>The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) is funding a project to
investigate the feasibility of an Irish Data Archive. The Data
Archive at Essex was asked to undertake the feasibility study and
Bridget Winstanley attended a scoping meeting in Dublin in December
last year. Kevin Schurer has been appointed to carry out the
feasibility study which will report to the SSRC in June this year.</dd>
<dd>Ken Hannigan&rsquo;s report pays tribute to the influence of IASSIST on
the activity in Ireland:</dd>
<dd>&ldquo;IASSISTers (yourself, Denise, Mark) have been directly involved
while others such as Peggy Adams and Tom Browne have been offering
intellectual and practical support from a distance.</dd>
<dd>You noted in your report last year that Mark Conrad had been
appointed as a Fulbright Scholar in the Archives Department of
University College Dublin for the academic year 1995-96. He finished
his stint in June 1996 but I think that his influence over the
archival profession here will be felt for a long time to come.&rdquo;</dd>

<dt><strong>EconData: a Dutch data service for economic data</strong></dt>
<dd>In the summer of 1996 SWIDOC&rsquo;s Steinmetz Archive started the
project EconData to establish a Dutch data service for economic
data. This service will be integrated with the current activities of
the archive. EconData builds on previous feasibility studies
conducted by the Economic and Social Institute (ESI) in Amsterdam
and the Economic Institute Tilburg (EIT). Both of these studies have
been funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research
(NWO). For EconData the Steinmetz Archive receives additional
funding from NWO. This grant follows on a recommendation by the
Social Science Council (SWR) of the Royal Nether-lands Academy of
Arts and Sciences (KNAW).</dd>
<dd>EconData aims at broadening the scope of the Steinmetz Archive. New
services will be established to support economic research, including
macro-economics, business eco-nomics and economic modelling. In
addition the more traditional functions of a data archive, EconData
puts strong emphasis on data brokerage. The data service will act as
an intermediary between suppliers of economic data and data users.
This will include suppliers of international data and users of Dutch
data abroad. For this purpose the project plan includes the
establishment of an online register of available data sets,
irrespective of whether these data sets are available from the
Steinmetz Archive or from other sources. EconData will be evaluated
after two years.</dd>
<dd>On July 1 drs. Albert Bots joined the Steinmetz Archive to act as
project coordinator. He is currently active as lecturer at the
department of Economics of the Free Univer-sity, Amster-dam. He is
one of the authors of the aforementioned feasibility study by EIT.</dd>

<dt><strong>ECASS</strong></dt>
<dd>Marcia Taylor has sent the following report:</dd>
<dd>The opening of the European Centre for Analysis in the Social
Sciences (ECASS), a new large scale facility in the social sciences
for European research and data analysis at the University of Essex
was announced in the last issue. ECASS is an interdisciplinary
research centre which conducts and facilitates the empirical study
of social and economic change by integrating longitudinal and
cross-national European datasets, providing support services
required for their analyses, and acting as the host for major
substantive research programmes, primary among them being
longitudinal household panel and time budget studies. The Centre is
coordinated by Marcia Freed Taylor, with John Brice as Database
Manager. A short regular report on the ECASS activities and
developments will appear in this and subsequent issues.</dd>
<dd>During its initial three months, the Centre has hosted several
longer research visits, among them a visit of several weeks by Dr.
Juergen Schupp from the Deutsches Institut fuer
Wissenschaftsforschung in Berlin. Dr. Schupp works on the German
Socio-economic Panel Study at DIW and carried out comparative
analysis on the British Household Panel Study in collaboration with
Dr. Malcolm Brynin of the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-social
Change. He also spent some time with the Data Archive, identifying
other potential data sources for further comparative work.</dd>
<dd>A research group from Belgium and the Netherlands, organised by Dr
Walter Van Dongen, visited ECASS in March for a series of
collaborative workshops with members of the ESRC Research Centre on
Micro-social Change. A primary focus of interest of the seven
researchers was the study of both the household division of labour
and of female employment using the cross-national Time Budget data
sets held by ECASS and the British Household Panel Study. Those who
visited were from the Population and Family Study Centre (CBSG) in
Antwerp (Van Dongen), the Panel Study of Belgian Households (Prof.
Therese Jacobs), the University of Limburg (Prof. Mieke Van
Haegendoren), and the Department of Comparative Population and
Gender Economics of the University of Amsterdam (Prof. Hettie
Pott-Buter, Dr. Kea Tijdens, Drs Susan Van Velzen and Wouter
Buitenhuis). To continue with the joint research projects begun
during this visit with Prof. Jay Gershuny and Dr Malcolm Brynin of
the ESRC Research Centre, a follow-up visit is planned for later in
the year.</dd>
<dd>The summer will be a particularly busy time, with over 16 fellows
present. Some of these will attend courses at the Essex Summer
School in Social Science Data Analysis and Collection (under full or
partial ECASS bursaries) in addition to the comparative research
work carried out using ECASS resources.</dd>
<dd>ECASS offers fellowships for periods of two weeks to three months to
scientific researchers carrying out non-proprietary research who are
nationals of a member state of the European Community or of an
Associated State (currently Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and
Israel), and who are working inside a member state of the European
Community, or an Associated State. While UK researchers can make use
of the facilities and assistance ECASS provides, EC rules prohibit
the payment of travel and/or subsistence costs. UK researchers are
nonetheless urged to apply to ECASS, which will provide them with
help in obtaining access to the data sources on social change held
at Essex and with assistance in their analysis.</dd>
