Dionne, Allison Bayley, and Gaetan Drolet. Membership fees have not
changed since last year. The association has one (1) year&rsquo;s operating
funds in the bank. Conferences tend to break even. Discretionary funds
are needed for one-time expenses, and funding of new initiatives. She
proposed raising membership fees to US$50.00 ($20.00 for students to
take effect next July (2001). The membership year has been shifted to
July through June to improve management of the process; membership fees
can be paid with conference fees.</p>

<h3 id="7-reports-of-action-groups">7. Reports of Action Groups</h3>
<h4 id="71-outreach-action-group-ilona-einowski">7.1 Outreach Action Group (Ilona Einowski)</h4>
<p>I Einowski outlined the intent of the Outreach AG is to support
professionals from emerging economies. The first activity was in 1997.
In total 15 people have been able to attend IASSIST through this
initiative. Financial support has been through the commitment of funds
to the initiative by the Administrative Committee, and the good will of
the membership. The AG has looked for outside funding: the World Bank is
willing to entertain an application. Other sources are also being
explored. Activity thus far has centered on Eastern Europe, but the AG
would like to expand to Latin America and Asia. The AG is also exploring
fostering mentoring arrangements between emerging and established data
services.</p>
<p>P Burnhill announced that the term of the Outreach AG will to be renewed
for another year.</p>
<h4 id="72-liaison-and-representation-action-group">7.2 Liaison and Representation Action Group</h4>
<p>P Burnhill explained the intent of this Action Group, which constitutes
IASSISTs representation to other organizations. Such representation was
once active, but it has since lost momentum. Therefore there is need to
rethink at both national and international levels, and possibly
coordinate with the regional secretariates.</p>
<h3 id="8-elections">8. Elections</h3>
<p>Approximately 50% of the Administrative Committee positions will be due
for re-election in the fall of 2000. A Nominations and Elections
