                          <p>Meeting of the General Assembly, Thursday, May 26, 2005, Edinburgh,
Scotland, UK</p>
<h3 id="1-welcome-and-remarks-a-green">1. Welcome and remarks (A Green)</h3>
<p>The meeting was called to order at 13:00 with circa 100 persons present.
A Green welcomed all to the meeting, with an especial welcome to all new
IASSIST members. She added that 2/3 of participants at the conference
are from other countries, and a total of 23 countries are represented at
the conference; it is especially important to maintain this
international flavour. Opportunities for involvement in the Association
include: (a)  the listserv, which averages 50 messages per week and is
used for communications about documentation, jobs, looking for data,
where IASSIST announces conference planning, etc.; (b) participating in
committees (information on committees is available on the IASISST web
site, and the meetings of committees at this conference are posted on
the bulletin board at the registration desk); (c) via submitting papers
for publication in the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ). Five past presidents of
IASSIST are at this conference.</p>
<h3 id="2-approval-of-the-minutes-of-the-2004-annual-general-meeting">2. Approval of the minutes of the 2004 Annual General Meeting</h3>
<p>Motion to accept the minutes: moved: T Trost; seconded E Boyko. CARRIED.</p>
<h3 id="3-matters-arising-additions-to-agenda">3. Matters arising, additions to agenda</h3>
<p>There being none.</p>
<h3 id="4-iassist-strategic-plan-publications-award-kb-rasmussen">4. IASSIST Strategic Plan Publications Award <em>(K.B. Rasmussen)</em></h3>
<p>The IASSIST Strategic Plan Publications Award committee was chaired by L
Neidert. All papers submitted will be published in the IQ. The winner of
the 2005 award was Reduce, reuse, recycle: issues in the secondary use
of research data, by Margaret Law, University of Alberta. Prize consists
of a one-year membership in IASSIST, as well as a cash award.</p>
<p>(A Green) The Strategic Plan publications award will be continued for
the 2005/2006  year; the deadline for submission will likely be in
January of 2006.</p>
<h4 id="5-reports-of-regional-secretaries">5. Reports of Regional Secretaries</h4>
<p>Reports of the Regional Secretaries will be posted on the IASSIST web
site within a week of the conference. A Green thanked the Regional
secretaries for their work for the Association.</p>
<h3 id="6-reports-of-officers">6. Reports of Officers</h3>
<h4 id="61-president---ann-green">6.1 President - Ann Green</h4>
<p>Thanks to outgoing members of the Administrative Committee: P Adams, R
Dekker, S Giles (continuing as chair of the Membership Committee), L
Corti, C Severt and F Booker.</p>
<p>Financially the Association is in good shape; the listserv is active;
membership has grown 9%.</p>
<p>The Association has held its first electronic election with a 55%
response rate. Conducting the election electronically was very
successful, as it shortens time it takes to hold an election, and
generally is more efficient. Thanks to the Nominations and Elections
Committee, and especially C Humphrey and J Weintrop.</p>
<p>The Strategic Plan Publications Award is intended to help strengthen the
IQ. The next publications award will have a new subject focus, although
still a component of the IASSIST strategic plan.</p>
<p>There have been bylaw changes: the former Australia Region is now the
Asia/Pacific Region. And the former Outreach Interest Group is now a
formal, on-going committee. The Association is indebted to I Einowski
for her nine years of dedication to this project.</p>
<p>Work continues on the membership database, which will soon give us
on-line access to membership information. Thanks to B Wandschneider and
his staff.</p>
<p>Turnover in the officers of the Association is a way of adding new
perspectives: both the treasurer, and the Outreach coordinator are
resigning. Members are encouraged to participate in committees and
conferences, fiscal planning, keep posting interesting information and
questions on the listserv, and keep the IQ strong.</p>
<h4 id="62-treasurer---w-thomas">6.2 Treasurer - W Thomas</h4>
<p>The Association is in good fiscal condition, with a balance sheet up
about $30k. There has been a modest increase in membership. There have
been two changes in the past year &ndash; J Dionne has retired and the
Association accounts have moved to California. Paying the membership fee
via credit card has proven to be a very popular option.</p>
<p>A Green thanked W Thomas for all her work on behalf of the Association.</p>
<h3 id="7-reports-of-committees">7. Reports of Committees</h3>
<p><strong>7.1</strong> Education Committee - E Boyko: Members were admonished to keep an
eye open for the next issue of the IQ which will be on statistical
literacy. Seven IASSIST members collaborated on the content, and the
issue has been edited by W Watkins and L Corti. IASSIST needs to adopt
themes and write about them.</p>
<p>The Education Committee has had an active year, and is putting together
plans for the next.</p>
<p><strong>7.2</strong> Membership Committee - B. Wandschneider for S Giles: Membership is
up, with 63 new members in the Association. The regional distribution of
memberships is similar to that in the past. One of strengths of the
Association consists in that 115 members have been members for 3 years
or longer. The membership database is now up and running. The committee
wants to add additional contextual information, however, such as how
long you have been an IASSIST member, etc.</p>
<p><strong>7.3</strong> Publications and Communications Committee - KB Rasmussen &amp; R Rice:
Rasmussen reemphasized the upcoming special double issue (issues 2-3) on
a theme. He acknowledged the many people who work on IQ, including
proof-readers, and volunteers for proof-reading are solicited.  R Rice
added that the IASSIST web site can also use more help. Thanks
especially to P Baxter for work on web site.</p>
<p><strong>7.4</strong> Outreach Committee - I Einowski: Einowski expressed delight that
this is now an on-going committee, which represents a more permanent
commitment by IASSIST. Outreach has enabled 42 people to attend IASSIST
over the past 9 years. This year four attendees received funding by
Outreach.</p>
<p><strong>7.5</strong> Nominations &amp; Elections Committee - P Burnhill: Burnhill thanked D
Geraci for helping with the elections process. The Association has a
full leadership: E Boyko is the incoming president; M Wright is the
incoming vice-president. Election results are posted on the IASSIST web
site. The election was for regional secretaries for two year terms, as
well as for members of the Administrative  Committee for four year
terms. A special thanks to A Green, who now becomes immediate past
president. A lot has been achieved in the past 4 years, she provided the
infrastructure for that scope for those accomplishments.</p>
<h3 id="8-reports-of-action-groups">8. Reports of Action Groups</h3>
<p><strong>8.1</strong> Stetegic Plan Implementation Action Group - K McNeil-Harman: The AG
is taking a step back to assess what has been done so far. The AG
welcomes new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>8.2</strong> Data Documentation &amp; Citation Interest Group - R Nakao: Nakao has
just been renamed co-chair w G Drolet and two interest groups merge.
There is a role to play in DDI and in the promotion of citation
standards and guidelines. Interested volunteers are actively sought.</p>
<h3 id="9-conference-reports">9. Conference Reports</h3>
<p>9.1. 2004 Conference- A Green</p>
<p>9.2 2005 Conference - A Bayley: The conference has 212 registered
delegates, 50 from the UK, 50 from elsewhere in Europe, and the
remainder from elsewhere.</p>
<p>9.3 2006 Conference- E Austin: ICPSR and two additional sponsors will be
hosting the IASSIST conference from May 23-26, 2006. Much of the
conference will occur at the Michigan Union for functions, sessions and
lunches.</p>
<p>9.4 2007 - A Khouri: IASSIST has accepted a proposal to hold the 2007
conference in Montréal at McGill University. The conference will be a
collaboration among 4 universities, 2 French and 2 English. Montréal is
a safe city, very European in flavour. All are very welcome to Montréal
in 2007.</p>
<h3 id="10-other-business">10. Other Business</h3>
<p><strong>10.1</strong> Turkey Action Group Report - L Ruus: The Turkey Action Group is the
longest standing action group in IASSIST history, with the largest
volunteer/membership base. All are encouraged to attend the TAG meeting
at Jury&rsquo;s Inn 11:30 tonight.</p>
<p><strong>10.2</strong> R Rice: Turn in evaluation form, get a raffle ticket.</p>
<h3 id="11moved-to-adjourn">11.Moved to adjourn</h3>
<p>Moved C Humphrey; seconded C van der Meer. The meeting adjourned at
13:45.</p>
