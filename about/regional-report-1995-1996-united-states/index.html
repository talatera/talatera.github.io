                          <p>Report of the U.S. Regional Secretary</p>
<p>by
Laura Guy
Data and Program Library Service
University of Wisconsin, Madison
May 1996</p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to share members&rsquo; activites beyond the
scope of IASSIST itself, including local, national and international
activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Member Activities:
<ul>
<li>Chuck Humphrey moved down from his post on the ICPSR Council.
Currently three members of IASSIST are on Council: Elizabeth
Stephenson, Ann Gray, and Wendy Watkins.</li>
<li>Wendy Treadwell continues her involvement in APDU. She completed
Doug Mills&rsquo; term on the APDU Board from October through
December, and was then elected to a term on the ADPU Board in a
member-at-large position. She chairs the Conference Committee in
this capacity. She is currently also serving on the selection
committee for the position of Executive Administrator (which
will include a new administrative home for APDU). She was
Program Co-Chair of the October 1995 Conference, and continues
in that role. Members Laura Guy (University of Wiscosin) and
Gregory Haley (Columbia University) presented a workshop on
International Data Resources for APDU. The day-long session was
very well attended, and brought in a number of non-North
American participants. Other IASSIST members, including Denise
Lievesley, Bill Bradley, Ed Spar, and Richard Rockwell
contributed to the success of the conference.
According to Wendy: &ldquo;I think you should note that IASSIST
REALLY made its presence felt at APDU95 in very positive way.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The ICPSR Biennial Meeting was held in early October, and was,
as usual, well-represented by IASSIST members. Jim Jacobs (UCSD)
and Diane Geraci (SUNY-Binghamton) delivered a workshop on
Working with ICPSR Services and Data. Members Judith Rowe, Laura
Guy, Gregory Haley, Ilona Einowski, Elizabeth Stephenson, Ernie
Boyko, Chris Davis, and Andrew Beveridge also made
contributions.</li>
<li>Denise Lievesley, Chuck Humphrey, Jim Jacobs, and Diane Geraci
taught in the ACSPRI 12th Summer Program in Social Research
Methods and Research Technology at Australian National
University in January 1996.</li>
<li>APLIC-I (Assoc for Population Libraries/Information Centers) is
sponsoring an Internet Room at the annual meeting of the
Population Assoc of America (PAA) in New Orleans May 9-11, 1996.
APLIC members will provide seminars and one-on-one training in
use of the Internet and its resources , along with handouts and
suggestions for PAA members on improving thier access to and use
of the Internet once they return to their institutions. Member
Wendy Brand (UW-Madison) will be one of the information
specialist offering assistance/training. Member Ruth Sandor
(UW-Madison) helped with planning and practical details.</li>
<li>Laura Guy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, published a review
in the Journal of Government Information (Vol. 23, No. 1) of CPS
Utilities, produced by the Unicon Research Corporation.</li>
<li>Lynn Ackerman has left the Data Archivist at the Population
Research Institute (PRI) at Penn State and taken a position with
the PA Assoc of Non-Profit Homes for the Aging as a Research
Analyst in Harrisburg, PA. The position is more closely related
to her Masters in Public Administration. She reports that
she&rsquo;ll actually be using primary data now - data collected from
the 250 members (non-profit nursing homes in PA).</li>
<li>Member extraordinaire Judith Rowe has completed her second third
year term on the Census Advisory Committee as well as her term
on the Depository Library Council.</li>
<li>The University of Pennsylvania has a campus data warehouse of
academic information. Member Pat Hildebrand is part of a task
force that is working on making access available through the Web
(probably via Oracle WebServer) while maintaining the required
security.</li>
<li>Two IASSIST members have been elected members of the 9 person
Steering Committee for the national State Data Center program
under the aegis of the U.S. Census Bureau. They are Annette
Watters from Alabama and John Blodgett from Missouri.
The Steering Committee will be working closely with the Census
Bureau over the next months as budget cutbacks, electronic
dissemination of information, and changing priorities start to
shake the data world. They report having already begun to see
differing points of view emerge.</li>
<li>Member Lisa Neidert, University of Michigan, was a focus group
participant on the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Data Access and
Dissemination System (DADs), Washington, D.C., September
19, 1995. She is co-organizer of a conference to be held in Ann
Arbor this summer: &ldquo;Workshop on Using U.S. Census Data to Study
the Elderly&rdquo;, July 14-19, 1996. She also gave two talks: &ldquo;Some
thoughts on sharing data&rdquo; Presentation made at a confrence on
Population and Politics in South Africa, Ann Arbor, Michigan,
February 2-4, 1995, and &ldquo;Which is the Real Archive: PSC or
PSID&rdquo; Presentation made to the staff of the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics, Ann Arbor, Michigan, September 26, 1995. She
also combined the 5% and 3% PUMS to create an 8% file of
households with a respondent of 60+.</li>
<li>Member Tess Trost will be presenting a paper on &ldquo;Managing a
Data Archive at Texas Tech University&rdquo; on Friday (26 April) at
the Texas Library Association Annual Meeting in Houston. She has
also also started to become active in the Law and Political
Science Section of ACRL of ALA, where she reports that &ldquo;no one
seems to knows very much about data&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Member Jean Stratford, UC Davis, continued her involvement with
GODORT.</li>
<li>Ann Green (Yale), Pat Doyle (Census Bureau), and John Brandt
(University of Michigan) continue their involvement on the ICPSR
Committee to develop a codebook DTD for SGML. The draft DTD will
be available for review at the &lsquo;96 IASSIST Conference.</li>
<li>Jim Jacobs and Diane Geraci, along with Chuck Humphrey, continue
their instruction of the ICPSR annual Course on Data
Librarianship and Data Archives.</li>
<li>Activities of all IASSIST members at the Center for Electronic
Records at the the U.S. National Archives and Records
Administration.
<ul>
<li>IASSIST members at the Center for Electronic Records, U.S.
National Archives and Records Administration have had a very
full year since the IASSIST meeting in Quebec. Among other
things, Center staff have been participating in Archivist
John Carlin&rsquo;s strategic directions planning initiative. His
new plan for the National Archives will be released in the
summer, 1996. In addition, all staff coped with the
uncertainties of the funding of the federal budget for FY
96, as did all our federal colleagues. The Center&rsquo;s staff
were placed on furlough from November 14-17, 1996. Despite
the hiatus in our ability to do our jobs, staff received
salary for this period. The FY 96 appropriation for the
National Archives and Records Administration passed both
houses of Congress and was signed by President Clinton as
part of one of the omnibus spending bills that signaled the
end to the first budget impasse of the fiscal year.</li>
<li>Two of the Center&rsquo;s IASSIST members have received major
honors during this past year. Fynnette Eaton was named a
Fellow of the Society of American Archivists, elected chair
of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives Conference, and
selected for the 1996 Technology Excellence Award by the
[federal] Interagency Committee on Information Resources
Management for designing and implementing the Archival
Preservation System. Mark Conrad was named a Fulbright
Scholar in Ireland for the 1995-96 academic year. He is
teaching archival studies with an emphasis on electronic
records at University College Dublin. While we are at
IASSIST, Mark will be visiting Finland under the auspices of
the Finnish Fulbright Commission, where he will lecture on
electronic records management at the Department of
Information Studies at the University of Tampere,
participate in a workshop to help faculty there add records
management to their curriculum, and will also lecture on
electronic records management at the Abo Akademi in Turku.
Following this, he will spend a day at the Finnish National
Archives, talking about electronic records issues with staff
and then travel to Sweden where he will participate in a
workshop on electronic records and authenticity. He also
plans to visit the Swedish National Archives.</li>
<li>IASSISTers were among the many visitors to the Center for
Electronic Records in this past year. They included Denise
Lievesley, Director of the ESRC Archives at the University
of Essex, United Kingdom, who met with us to discuss the new
directions of both the archival and preservation programs in
the Center. Alan Lubanski, London School of Economics,
visited the Center as part of his survey of North American
data service organizations. In addition, Judith Rowe and
Doug Mills, Princeton University and Susan Adler of Rand met
last July at the National Archives at College Park with Tom
Brown, Peggy Adams, and Ted Hull of the Center and Pat
Berman, Bureau of the Census, Karl Taueber of the University
of Wisconsin, and Eric Austin of ICPSR to discuss the fate
of 1970 Census of Population and Housing summary tape files.
Ken Hannigan of the National Archives of Ireland
participated in a SAA preconference practicum the Center
hosted in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Society
of American Archivists.</li>
<li>During Ken Thibodeau&rsquo;s six-month detail to the Department
of Defense, June-December, 1995, Fynnette Eaton and Tom
Brown each served as Director of the Center for Electronic
Records for a three-month period. Last fall, Thibodeau,
Brown, and Eaton visited the National Archives of Canada to
discuss approaches to the archival administration of
electronic records. Eaton and Brown represented the National
Archives on the [U.S.] Government Printing Office&rsquo;s Study
to Identify Measures Necessary for a Successful Transition
to a More Electronic Federal Depository Library Program.
Peggy Adams represented the Center at the biennial meeting
of Official Representatives of ICPSR in October, 1995. Tom
Brown represents IASSIST at the quarterly meetings of
COPAFS. Tom Southerly provided this representation for the
September COPAFS meeting. Peggy Adams was appointed to the
SAA Awards Committee and presented the Waldo Gifford Leland
Award at the 1995 SAA meeting. Adams, Brown, and Eaton all
participated in the seminar on electronic records that the
Center hosted for a group of international archivists who
met following the 1995 SAA meeting.</li>
<li>The Center has compiled a bibliography of publications and
presentations by staff of the Center for Electronic Records.
Copies are available upon request. Included from this past
year&rsquo;s activities by the Center&rsquo;s IASSIST members are:
Peggy Adams&rsquo; book review of Managing Electronic Records by
William Saffady, American Archivist, Vol. 57, Summer 1994,
pp. 560-562, appeared in the summer of 1995. Adams organized
and participated on a panel at the 1995 annual meeting of
the Society of American Archivists, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s All This About
the Next Generation? A Practitioners&rsquo; Discussion of
Electronic Records Issues.&rdquo; She also gave a presentation on
electronic records for Women&rsquo;s Studies at the SAA Women&rsquo;s
Collection Roundtable. In March 1996, Adams spoke on
&ldquo;Adapting to New Technologies&rdquo; for the Society for History
in the Federal Government.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Tom Brown chaired and offered comments for a session at the
1995 SAA meeting, &ldquo;Toto, We Aren&rsquo;t in Kansas Anymore:
Issues of Access for Archives on the Internet.&rdquo; He also led
a practicum on accessioning electronic records as a SAA
meeting preconference session.</li>
<li>Fynnette Eaton presented the keynote paper: &ldquo;Ensuring
Access to America&rsquo;s Electronic Information&rdquo; at the 12th
Office Information Technology Conference in Augusta, GA in
July 1995. She talked on &ldquo;Automated Preservation of
Electronic Records: A Case Study of the Archival
Preservation System&rdquo; at the 1995 SAA meeting. She also led
a practicum on preservation of electronic records as a
preconference SAA session. In September she presented a
paper on the issues of technology obsolesence to the
Virginia Association of Government Archives and Records
Administrators and in March Fynnette was the after-dinner
speaker at the 1996 DPMA (Data Processing Managers
Association) Joint Chapters Meeting in Lanham, Maryland. Her
talk focused on the holdings and preservation activities at
the Center for Electronic Records.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issues (Ethnocentric and Others):
<ul>
<li>Attempt by Princeton administration to save operating expenses
by eliminating Data and Statistical Services which had been
housed for many years in the CIT facility; protests on the part
of faculty and students as well as by such outside supporters as
the 40 IASSIST members who signed a joint letter has resulted in
some effort to preserve these services.</li>
<li>U.S. Government Shutdowns and Budget Slashing</li>
<li>Threats to NSF and General Uncertainty over Research Funding</li>
<li>IASSIST members and colleagues from Columbia, Cornell, CUNY
(Baruch, Queens, and CUNY Central), NYU, and Yale have
established a regional interest group called the Tri-State Data
Archive Planning Committee. The purpose of the group is to
exchange information about issues such as: data rescue projects,
online data documentation, data extract programs, and joint
acquisitions. A test data-holdings catalog was produced by Lynn
Jacobsen and Greg Haley at Columbia, with holdings information
from 3 of the universities.</li>
<li>Changes to the GPO Depository Library Program including
increasing reliance on information provision via the Internet
and such portable electronic media as CD&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>Initiation of the US Census program to make extracts from an
increasing number of their data products available from their
home page as well as more limited programs at Harvard and the
University of Virginia.</li>
<li>Availability of &ldquo;home-grown&rdquo; data sets from web pages at the
Universities of Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin-Madison,
among others. (All of these efforts are publicly available,
unlike several other efforts limited to internal users).</li>
<li>Changes at the ICPSR: media, delivery, etc.</li>
<li>Decreasing Budgets at all Levels.</li>
<li>Technological changes; Impact of the increased use of the
Internet for provision of Services.</li>
