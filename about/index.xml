::: {style=&amp;quot;font-size:12px;&amp;quot;}
 Introduction The year has been a very busy and prosperous one for European data and technology initiatives. Some of these are described below. I apologise if the balance information seems to be largely with Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. My appeal over the IASSIST listserv for information from non-UK countries was answered only by Ken Hannigan on behalf of Ireland and Michal Peleg for Israel.</description>

CENSUS : 2006 is a Census year and the day I am writing this is actually Census Day &amp;ndash; the day we are all supposed to fill in our Census. In Canada it is against the law to not do this and of course all Canadians are law abiding (apparently only 5 people were convicted in 2001). So guess what &amp;ndash; I just filled out my Census and I filled it out on-line!</description>

This report begins with some observations on cross-national collaborations, after which will be country-by-country reports of national/institutional/individual activities. I have only included reports for those people/organisations/countries/projects from whom I have received information.
All in all, seems that the Europeans (at least in the field of data archiving) have had their share of organisational changes.</description>

      <description>What is an IASSIST interest group? At its most basic, it&amp;rsquo;s composed of at least 4 members plus a coordinator. They want to know more about a topic of professional interest and share what they know and learn with the larger IASSIST membership. The larger the interest group, the greater they synergy! Interest groups are also a good way to stay connected to other members if you can&amp;rsquo;t attend the annual conferences very often.</description>

Inauguration of a new administration brings substantial changes in the executive branch. As preparation for the decennial Census intensifies, there&amp;rsquo;s been scrutiny of the President&amp;rsquo;s choice(s) for Commerce Secretary as well as his Census Bureau nominee, Robert Groves. Both Secretary Gary Locke and Groves (director of the Survey Research Institute, University of Michigan) addressed concerns of some in Congress; that is, the latter&amp;rsquo;s past support for statistical sampling in the decennial Census.</description>

National Statistical Agencies Events at the U.S. Census Bureau generated quite a stir, the most important one being the resignation of Director Charles Kincannon and Deputy Director Hermann Habermann in November 2006. Mr. Kincannon cited &amp;ldquo;shifting priorities&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;changing family responsibilities&amp;rdquo; as his reasons for stepping down, although he continues as Director pending nomination and confirmation of his replacement.</description>
