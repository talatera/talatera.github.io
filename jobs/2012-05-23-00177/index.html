                          <p class=""><strong>Employer:</strong>  Simon Fraser University Library</p>
                          <p class=""><strong>Employer URL:</strong> <a href="http://www.lib.sfu.ca/">http://www.lib.sfu.ca/</a></p>
                          <p class=""><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                          <p>Simon Fraser University Library is seeking a highly flexible,
collaborative and innovative individual,
committed to providing the best possible service to faculty and
students, to undertake a range of
project-based and operational activities that will advance the SFU
Library&rsquo;s strategic objectives in a
number of related areas: data curation and management, digital
preservation, and research data
services.</p>
<p>Simon Fraser University (SFU) is a comprehensive university with
approximately 22,000 undergraduate
students, 5000 graduate students, 950 faculty and 1500 staff. Ranked by
respected national surveys as
one of Canada&rsquo;s top three comprehensive universities for the past 20
years, Simon Fraser University has
also been named one of British Columbia&rsquo;s top 40 Employers for 2011, as
well as one of Canada&rsquo;s top
100 employers. SFU offers more than 100 undergraduate major and joint
major programs and more
than 45 graduate offerings, spanning many disciplines in eight
faculties, and has an international
reputation for its innovative interdisciplinary and professional
programs. The University was established
in 1965 in Burnaby and has since expanded to Vancouver and Surrey. SFU
is integrally involved in the
life of all three of its campus communities, including participation in
a range of urban renewal and
development initiatives. Further information about SFU is available at
<a href="http://www.sfu.ca">www.sfu.ca</a>.</p>
<p>The SFU Library has an international reputation as a technologically
innovative site which is best
exemplified by its role as the home for several major open source
software projects &ndash; the Public
Knowledge Project (PKP) and reSearcher. PKP develops and supports a
range of scholarly
communications software applications including Open Journal Systems
(OJS) which, as of March 2012,
has been installed at over 12,800 sites around the world. reSearcher is
a suite of library software
modules including Godot, a link resolver, and CUFTS, an electronic
resource management system and
knowledgebase. The library also has an active digitization program and
has been the recipient of several
grants to undertake some large digitization projects. The library
maintains most of the technical
infrastructure required for these initiatives and has assembled a very
skilled team of systems and
technical specialists.</p>
<p>Within the SFU Library, planning and project-based initiatives often
cross divisional and campus
boundaries. The Library Planning Committee (Dean, AULs, Division Heads)
is responsible for advising the
Dean on budget, personnel and external matters. The Library Council
(Dean, AULs, Division/Unit Heads,
seven library staff representatives) advises on other matters. There are
few standing committees, with
cross-divisional task groups typically planning and guiding specific
projects. Further information about
the Library is available at: <a href="http://www.lib.sfu.ca">www.lib.sfu.ca</a>.</p>
<p>Reporting jointly to the Head, Library Systems for operational duties
and a Project Management Team
for project-related assignments, this is a unique opportunity that
combines a major research data
project funded by the University Priority Fund (UPF) with the
implementation of several key objectives
for digital preservation and research data services in the Library&rsquo;s
Strategic Plan for 2011-2016. The
Data Curation and Digital Preservation Specialist will play an important
support role on the UPF-funded
Data Curation project while also working closely with several senior
Library staff to plan and implement
the Library&rsquo;s vision for expanded services and support for digital
preservation and research data
services.
The Data Curation and Digital Preservation Specialist will be based in
Library Systems with close working
relationships with Research Data Services, Research Commons, the
Library&rsquo;s Liaison Librarians, and the
Library&rsquo;s Institutional Repository staff. The Library expects to engage
external consulting services to
assist with planning and implementation of the Data Curation project and
this position will also work
closely with them. The Data Curation and Digital Preservation Specialist
will collaborate with staff from
both inside and outside the library; and interact with faculty,
students, and various academic and
administration units throughout the university. This is an opportunity
for a recent graduate of a
library/information science or archival studies program, or other
practitioners, who are interested in
gaining extensive and invaluable experience in emerging research data
and digitization areas.
This is a two-year, internal grant funded position, with the possibility
of extension beyond the 2-year
term subject to funding availability.
