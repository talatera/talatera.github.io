                          <p>The Libraries of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) seek
applications from innovative and user-oriented library professionals to
join the enthusiastic staff of the The Social Sciences and Humanities
Library in the development of data services and collections. The UCSD
Libraries are committed to making access to research information for
faculty and students as efficient and convenient as technology,
innovation, and resources will allow.</p>
<p>The University and the Libraries</p>
<p>With a current enrollment of more than 26,000 students, UCSD is a
powerful magnet for those seeking a fresh innovative approach to
education and research. In just four decades, the campus has achieved
international distinction for its educational excellence, research
strength and institutional flexibility. Ranked fifth in the nation and
first in the University of California system in federal R&amp;D funding,
UCSD annually attracts more than $627 million in research awards. The
National Research Council ranks the campus 10th nationally in the
excellence of its graduate programs and quality of its faculty. US News
&amp; World Report ranks UCSD 7th nationally among public national
universities. UCSD has entered a period of major growth with planned
enrollment expected to reach 28,365 by 2010. The UCSD Libraries are
widely recognized as integral partners in the development and provision
of innovative, responsive, and effective information services vital to
the University&rsquo;s instructional and research enterprise.</p>
<p>The UCSD Libraries, a member of the Association of Research Libraries,

three million volumes. Integrated services dependent on information
technology are a hallmark of the UCSD Libraries. Recent projects include
desktop delivery of journal articles, network delivery of digital audio,
multilingual character interfaces, patron initiated interlibrary loan,
wireless network access, and a vigorous and ambitious Digital Library
Program. Components of the information infrastructure include INNOPAC,
the integrated library system; the UCSD campus web site; and the UCSD

faculty and students.</p>
