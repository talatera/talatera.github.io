                          <p class=""><strong>Description:</strong></p>
                          <p>Overall Purpose of the JobWe&rsquo;re looking for a data-savvy senior manager
based at Mimas who can lead the UK Data Service&rsquo;s Communications and
Impact function from blue-skies strategy to implementation.</p>
<p>This role will provide the right individual with both strategic input in
an Associate Director capacity along with the operational
responsibilities and support necessary to see visions become reality for
this national, growing online service.</p>
<p>The UK Data Service is funded by the ESRC to provide researchers and
analysts around the world with access to an extensive collection of
high-quality digital data critical for social and economic research.
Data in the collection come from a variety of sources including the UK
Census, government surveys, longitudinal studies, businesses,
international macrodata banks such as the IMF, and individual
researchers. Users range from the academic sector to a growing number of
analysts in business, the third sector, and all levels of government.</p>
<p>The post is strategically focused to support the UK Data Service in
engaging with data users, data owners and other stakeholders in the UK
and abroad, as well as developing opportunities for enhancing the role
through projects and innovations that supplement the Service. A key
responsibility is to identify, develop and extend the Service&rsquo;s impact.
The Communications and Impact function is part of the UK Data Service
Outreach function, which also includes User Support and User Training.</p>
<p>We are looking for a dynamic and highly motivated individual to lead on
raising the visibility of the UK Data Service holdings and to find,
increase and promote the use and impact of the data and resources in
policy-relevant research, especially to new audiences such as
policymakers, government sectors, charities, the private sector and the
media. You will lead on the continued development and implementation of
an effective and sustainable communications and impact strategy and you
will need to have relevant previous experience in this area. A solid
understanding of evidence-based research in a variety of social science
disciplines is imperative. Experience in leading and managing
professional teams is essential together with effective high level
communication written and verbal communication skills.</p>
