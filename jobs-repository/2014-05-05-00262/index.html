<p>About the Digital Preservation Coalition
The DPC is an advocate and catalyst for digital preservation, enabling
our members to deliver resilient long-term access to content and
services, and helping them derive enduring value from digital
collections. We raise awareness of the importance of the preservation of
digital material and the attendant strategic, cultural and technological
issues. We are a not-for-profit membership organisation and we support
our members through knowledge exchange, capacity building, assurance,
advocacy and partnership. Our vision is to make our digital memory
accessible tomorrow.
Digital preservation is characterised by a supportive, international and
vibrant community which is growing rapidly. Cross-sector and
interdisciplinary collaborations are highly valued and they create the
conditions for creativity and innovation in the face of shared
challenges. The DPC was founded in 2002 and occupies a distinctive
position within this community. It works with and on behalf of the
leading experts in the field internationally and it has a world class
reputation.
At the time of writing the DPC has forty seven institutional members in
the UK and Ireland as well as a number of international partners and
allies around the world. It is funded principally through member
subscriptions and receives around half of its funds through externally
sponsored projects. It is currently a partner in four major projects
funded by the European Commission &ndash; TIMBUS, APARSEN, 4C and E-ARK and
it employs five full time staff with offices in London, Glasgow or York.
It is governed by a board of directors constituted from its full
members.

<p>Current DPC Research Projects
In the first 6 months, the primary focus of this post will be to deliver
DPC commitments to the TIMBUS project as it heads towards completion in
December 2014. In the second 6 months, the post holder will support a
range of research projects, especially a new collaborative project with
UK Data Archive co-funded by ESRC on the preservation of social media.
The DPC is a partner in the TIMBUS project that is co-funded by the
European Commission. It started in April 2011, runs until end of
December 2014, and is an &lsquo;Integrated Project&rsquo; &ndash; a project which
supports research to achieve a specific objective and where the primary
outcome is new knowledge.
The TIMBUS Project focuses on resilient business processes. It makes the
execution context, within which data is processed, analysed, transformed
and rendered, accessible over long periods. TIMBUS also considers the
dependencies on third-party services, information and capabilities that
are necessary to validate digital
<a href="http://www.dpconline.org">www.dpconline.org</a>
our digital memory accessible tomorrow
information in a future usage context. TIMBUS delivers activities,
processes and tools that ensure continued access to services and
software to produce the context within which information can be
accessed, properly rendered, validated and transformed into knowledge.
The project is organised into nine work packages.
The DPC is involved in three work packages: &lsquo;Exploitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Engineering
Services and Systems for Digital Preservation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dissemination and
Training&rsquo;, and is the project lead for the latter. &lsquo;Dissemination and
Training&rsquo; constitute the DPC&rsquo;s largest contribution to the project. The
work package has been singled out for particular praise in recent
reviews and core tools, relationships and controls are already well
established. As work package lead, the DPC is responsible for
co-ordinating and ensuring the development and delivery of training
materials derived from the TIMBUS Project, for managing and performing
dissemination tasks and for managing the project contributions to
standards. Whilst the post holder will be expected to contribute to all
of these from time to time they will be largely engaged in the
&lsquo;Dissemination and Training&rsquo; work package.
The DPC also participates in other current and future externally funded
projects. The successful candidate may be expected to contribute to them
in a role similar to the one described for TIMBUS.
For more information about the TIMBUS Project see:
<a href="http://timbusproject.net/">http://timbusproject.net/</a>
The DPC will shortly start a new collaborative research project with the
UK Data Archive on the preservation of &lsquo;big data&rsquo;, funded by ESRC. DPC
is a partner in two components of this research with responsibilities
for original research on the preservation of social media and the
preservation of transactional data. Deliverables from these work
packages will include consultation and briefing for DPC members and the
completion of &lsquo;Technology Watch Reports&rsquo;. The project is still in
development so the candidate will be expected to contribute to research
