      <description>&amp;ldquo;Data are larger than the social sciences&amp;rdquo; and data concerns have grown beyond the traditional communities comprising IASSIST.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;respondent to strategic plan survey (2009)
As preparations intensify for IASSIST 2011, I encourage IASSIST members to review the 2010-2014 Strategic Plan with its focus on Advocacy, Community, and Professional Development.
As IASSIST moves into the second year of the plan, the organization finds itself in an environment where data concerns have expanded to the point that many organizations have placed data curation, data sharing, and developing data literacy at the forefront of their agenda.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the new (May, 2010) IASSIST website, based on Drupal open source technology and hosted by LIS-host. The new logo and website artwork was commissioned by the Publications Chair, Walter Piovesan, and done by Josh Laidlaw, from British Columbia.
