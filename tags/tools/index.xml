      <description>Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) website has a new section devoted to Data Management and Curation, which provides a general guide on research data quality, preservation, access, confidentiality, and citation, and also explains how ICPSR, as a social science research data archive, is working hard to address all these issues. There is also a Tools &amp;amp; Services section compiling recommended applications that could help researchers deal with data confidentiality, restricted-use data, data processing, and dissemination.</description>
