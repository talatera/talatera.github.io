      <description>The Research Data Management Training, or MANTRA project has produced an open, online training course for PhD and early career researchers to learn best practices in data management.
In addition to the interactive, online module which covers data management topics such as Organising Your Data, there are downloadable software modules covering data handling skills in SPSS, R, NVivo and ArcGIS.
The resource was created by EDINA and Data Library, University of Edinburgh, and was funded by the JISC Managing Research Data programme.</description>
