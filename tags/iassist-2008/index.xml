The UK Data Service will present the following panel &amp;ldquo;The CESSDA Technical Framework - what is it and why is it needed?</description>

      <description>Regardless of the institutional setting in which we work, more and more of us are having to address researcher access to restricted or confidential datasets. This post focuses on sessions at Stanford that covered this important topic&amp;ndash;or rather, group of topics because there are so many intersecting responsibilities to actually making such access a reality for our users.
Lisa Neider&amp;rsquo;s poster session focused on the practicalities of &amp;ldquo;Administering Restricted Data Contracts.</description>

      <title>And so ends &#34;The Best IASSIST ever&#34;</title>

      <description>And another conference has passed. It&amp;rsquo;s so sad to think that it will be another year before we get together again but at least we can play virtually on our lists, this blog and maybe even in SecondLife! I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to round up more conference reports but in the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s the official conference song lyrics. Sing to the tune of The Band&amp;rsquo;s song &amp;ldquo;The Weight&amp;rdquo;
In case the tune doesn&amp;rsquo;t come to mind immediately, here&amp;rsquo;s a clip on YouTube from the movie &amp;ldquo;The Last Waltz&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Ready, Set, Go! IASSIST08 is in two worlds!</title>

      <description>So I had the best intentions to blog the conference but alas I was distracted - creating my SecondLife avatar to be able to participate virtually as well as in reality was far more interesting than I want to admit! My teenagers were appalled when they found out I was on Facebook
 what will they say when I tell them about SusieQue!  [](http://iassistblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/iassistsl_small.wmf) As a technology-oriented association hosting a technology-themed conference, it is maybe not surprising that we should experiment a bit.</description>

      <description>Happy Earth Day to everyone!!
Hope your day is filled with loads of celebratory reducing, renewing, and recycling.
Registration for this year&amp;rsquo;s IASSIST Conference (May 27-30): &amp;ldquo;Technology of Data: Collection, Communication, Access and Preservation&amp;rdquo; is proceeding at a rumbling pace, and the five conference hotels have been filling with eager California-bound IASSISTers.
However, if you still have not made your arrangements for this year&amp;rsquo;s conference, please consider doing so. Early registration ends soon (May 2), and of more immediate concern, the conference hotels will begin dropping our room blocks (and guaranteed conference rates) beginning this Friday, April 25.</description>

      <title>It was the best IASSIST ever!</title>

      <description>Until next year of course!
This year&amp;rsquo;s conference is done and Anastassia, Susan, and the wonderful Local arrangement folks at McGill are probably breathing a sigh of relief! Lots of informations was presented and some of it was absorbed! More will likely be reviewed over coming weeks preceded by the usual &amp;ldquo;Now I know I saw a presentation about this at IASSIST&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;
If you were one of those fine presenters, please don&amp;rsquo;t forget to submit a paper to the IQ (instructions for doing so are on the IASSIST website).</description>
