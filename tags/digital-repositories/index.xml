      <description>Our World and all the Local Worlds Welcome to the first issue of Volume 40 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 40:1, 2016). We present four papers in this issue. The first paper presents data from our very own world, extracted from papers published in the IQ through four decades. What is published in the IQ is often limited in geographical scope and in this issue the other three papers present investigations and project research carried out at New York University, Purdue University, and the Federal Reserve System.</description>

      <description>Open Repositories conference celebrated its first decade by having four full days of exciting workshops, keynotes, sessions, 24/7 talks, and development track and repository interest group sessions in Indianapolis, USA. All the fun took place in the second week of June. The OR2015 conference was themed &amp;ldquo;Looking Back/Moving Forward: Open Repositories at the Crossroads&amp;rdquo; and it brought over 400 repository developers and managers, librarians and library IT professionals, service providers and other experts to hot and humid Indy.</description>

      <title>A decade against decay: the 10th International Digital Curation Conference</title>

      <description>The International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC) is now ten years old. On the evidence of its most recent conference, is in rude health and growing fast.
IDCC is the first time IASSIST decided to formally support another organisational conference. I think it was a wise investment given the quality of plenaries, presentations, posters, and discussions.
DCC already has available a number of blogs covering the substance of sessions, including an excellent summary by IASSIST web editor, Robin Rice.</description>

      <description>I posted the following question to the listserv:
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in the early days of exploring what I and our library can do for our faculty and grad students. In my case I&amp;rsquo;m particularity interested in the social sciences.
It seems there are three main choices:
  ICPSR(or other domain-specific site)
  Dataverse with my own school&amp;rsquo;s branding
  Local, campus funded storage through an Institutional Repository or something else that can handle larger amounts of data.</description>

      <description>Last month, OpenAIRE (Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe) and re3data.org signed a Memorandum of Agreement to &amp;ldquo;work jointly to facilitate research data registration, discovery, access and re-use&amp;rdquo; in support of open science. OpenAIRE is an infrastructure for open access that works to track and measure research output (originally designed to monitor EU funding activities). re3data.org is an online listing of research data repositories.
re3data.org and OpenAIRE will exchange metadata in order for OpenAIRE to &amp;ldquo;integrate data repositories indexed in the re3data.</description>

      <title>The Role of Data Repositories in Reproducible Research</title>

      <description>Cross posted from ISPS Lux et Data Blog
These questions were on my mind as I was preparing to present a poster at the Open Repositories 2013 conference in Charlottetown, PEI earlier this month. The annual conference brings the digital repositories community together with stakeholders, such as researchers, librarians, publishers and others to address issues pertaining to &amp;ldquo;the entire lifecycle of information.&amp;rdquo; The conference theme this year, &amp;ldquo;Use, Reuse, Reproduce,&amp;rdquo; could not have been more relevant to the ISPS Data Archive.</description>

      <description>Open Repositories 2013 was hosted by the University of Prince Edward Island from July 8-12. A strong research data stream ran throughout this conference, which was attended by over 300 participants from around the globe. To my delight, many IASSISTers were in attendance, including the current IASSIST President and four Past-Presidents! Rarely do such sightings happen outside an IASSIST conference.
  IASSIST Five Presidents by Limor Peer   This was my first Open Repositories conference and after the cool reception that research data received at the SPARC IR meetings in Baltimore a few years ago, I was unsure how data would be treated at this conference.</description>

      <description>I was asked by a colleague about organized efforts within the economics community to develop or support repositories of code for research. Her experience was with the astrophysics world which apparently has several and she was wondering what could be learned from another academic community. So I asked a non-random sample of technical economists with whom I work, and then expanded the question to cover all of social sciences and posed the question to the IASSIST community.</description>

      <description>[]{.image-right}I &amp;lsquo;d been meaning to write an IASSIST blog post about OR 2012, hosted by the University of Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s Host Organising Committee led by Co-Chair and IASSISTer Stuart Macdonald in July, because it had such good DATA content.
Fortunately Simon Hodson, the UK&amp;rsquo;s JISC Managing Research Data Programme Manager, has provided this introduction and has allowed me to post it here, with further links to his analytic blog posts, and even those contain further links to OTHER blog posts talking about OR2012 and data!</description>

      <description>Luis Martinez-Uribe, Digital Repositories Research Co-ordinator, is based at the Oxford e-Research Centre and will be conducting a scoping study to capture researcher&amp;rsquo;s needs for repository services to manage, curate, preserve and disseminate research data generated in Oxford.
A new blog (http://oxdrrc.blogspot.com/) has been set-up to record the progress of the project while disseminating outputs and information about relevant activities. If you are interested in following the progress of this project you can subscribe to the RSS feed (http://oxdrrc.</description>

      <description>As part of the JISC-funded DISC-UK DataShare project{.moz-txt-link-freetext} in the UK, a State-of-the-Art Review has been written, marking out the current scene on data sharing at the beginning of the project. While the report is UK-focused, it may be of wider interest, and has a very thorough bibliography.
DISC-UK is a UK consortium of data support professionals working in departments and academic libraries in universities (Data Information Specialists Committee-United Kingdom). The project is about DISC-UK members (all of whom are also IASSIST members) working with academics and institutional repository managers at the four partner institutions - London School of Economics and the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Southampton - to provide exemplars for sharing research data within institutional repositories (based on EPrints.</description>

      <description>I am writing to address an issue that is coming up at UCLA with increasing frequency. More and more data distributors (agencies, archives, individuals) require a user to &amp;ldquo;register&amp;rdquo; before downloading data from a web site. These registrations take many forms and there is a continuum in terms of levels of detail and responsibility assigned to the user. It makes it hard for me to be of service to users when each study requires every individual to perform the registration task.</description>
