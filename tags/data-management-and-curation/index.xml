      <description>Several organizations have begun compiling lists of repositories of research data. These can be useful for researchers both to consider where to deposit their data, as well as for discovery for secondary data use.
DataBib
Tool to identify repositories of research data. Users can search (including field-level searching) or browse by subject or title. Each entry provides a description, standardized subjects, access, start date, and country, among other qualities. Anyone is able to suggest or edit repository listings, which then are reviewed and committed by an editorial board.</description>
