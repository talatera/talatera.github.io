      <description>Just to let you all know that here at the Economic and Social Data Service in the UK we have been working with the ESRC on a brochure to encourage data citation amongst our social scientists and journal publishers.
In October 2011 we minted over 5000 DOIs for our ESDS Collection with Datacite, using a methodology we developed to deal with version changes to our data. You can view our Webinar that explains how we do this.</description>

      <description>Building a Culture of Research Data Citation
Workshop at eResearch Australasia 2011
Thursday 10 November 2011: 9:00-12:30
http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/workshops/#8
The Australian National Data Service (ANDS) is currently developing a service called &amp;ldquo;Cite My Data&amp;rdquo; [1], which uses the international DataCite infrastructure [2] to support the citation of Australian research sector datasets. The DataCite infrastructure is built on the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system [3]&amp;ndash;widely used for citation and tracking of scholarly publications.</description>

      <title>IASSIST SIGDC Meeting Held in Vancouver</title>

      <description>The IASSIST Special Interest Group on Data Citation (SIGDC) met in Vancouver on Wednesday, June 1, with 15 people in attendance. The group discussed ways in which IASSIST members could influence data citation standards and behavior. Suggestions were made to:
 Inventory the resources that the SIG maintains and knows about Create a set of simple slides to share with faculty and students; these might include guidelines on citation format with examples but would not endorse a certain format Create posters on data citation to hang in prominent places Contact bibliographic software companies to make sure they include data as a specific resource type Contact style guides &amp;ndash; APA, Chicago, MLA &amp;ndash; to ensure that they are providing appropriate citations for data and including DOIs Create a set of Web pages on this topic on the IASSIST site Contact Google Scholar with a list of issues related to data  Joachim Wackerow presented information on ways to make DOIs more machine-actionable.</description>

      <description>We are pleased to announce the creation of a new Special Interest Group on Data Citation (SIGDC) to promote awareness of data-related research and scholarship through data citation. The group is co-chaired by Mary Vardigan and Michael Witt.
Citing data supports the discovery and reuse of data, leading to better science through the validation of results. It also recognizes data as an essential part of the scientific record. SIGDC will share information about its work through the IASSIST list, the IQ, the IASSIST blog, and sessions at the IASSIST conference as well as other venues and meetings.</description>

      <description>A week has passed since IASSIST 2009. I hope most of you have made it safely back home by now - and are ready to refresh the memories by watching the conference webcasts and viewing presentations. Webcasts of all three plenaries and Thursday and Friday&amp;rsquo;s concurrent sessions in the Small Auditorium are now available. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have cameras available during the Wednesday sessions, so no videos of these presentations, sorry! But most of the presentations are already online - a few are still missing either because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have them or we are waiting for an updated version.</description>

Winter came late in Denmark, but suddenly the situation was normal: snow came and traffic stopped. And now 14 days after spring was here in March. I sat outside in the sun reading articles. Still it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to write articles outside, we are waiting for the improvements of the computer screens. However, some people have stayed inside to write articles for the IASSIST Quarterly.</description>

      <description>In their never ending quest for information, Jen, Tiffani and Paula would like to know about people&amp;rsquo;s experiences cataloging data. Do you use MARC format? Have you tried using DDI? At what level do you tend to catalog collections? How does it depart from cataloging traditional library matter? Enquiring minds want to know.
