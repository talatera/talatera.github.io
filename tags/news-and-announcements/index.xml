      <description>On Saturday, April 27, 2019, IASSIST and the broader data professional&amp;rsquo;s community lost a valued colleague and friend, Darrell Donakowski. The IASSIST organization mourns his untimely death and wishes to recognize the significant contributions he made to the data community over the course of his career.

Friends and family have created a scholarship at the University of Michigan-Dearborn in his memory. At the suggestion of the several members and with the approval of the Administrative Committee, IASSIST has contributed $1000 to the scholarship to recognize the numerous contributions Darrell made to the data community right up to the time of his premature passing.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the third issue of volume 43 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 43:3, 2019).
Yes, we are open! Open data is good. Just a click away. Downloadable 24/7 for everybody. An open government would make the decisionmakers&amp;rsquo; data open to the public and the opposition. As an example, communal data on bicycle paths could be open, so more navigation apps would flourish and embed the information in maps, which could suggest more safe bicycle routes.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the second issue of volume 43 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 43:2, 2019).
With joy and pride the many people behind each issue of the IQ are here presenting a special issue. IASSIST has several interest groups of members committed to selected important areas under the umbrella of IASSIST. Be aware that you could become a member of an interest group (see: https://iassistdata.org/about/committees.html#interest). If an interest area that you find important is not presently on this list, you are invited to start campaigning for the formation of a new interest group.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first issue of volume 43 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 43:1, 2019).
The IASSIST Quarterly presents in this issue three papers illustrated in the title above. Chronologically we start from an early beginning. No, not with Turing, we time travel further back and experience ancient Greece. In this submission the Greek drama delivers the form, while data librarians deliver the content on data sharing. And it makes you a proud IASSISTer to know that altruism is the rationale behind data sharing.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fourth issue of volume 42 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 42:4, 2018).
The IASSIST Quarterly presents in this issue three papers. When you know how, cycling is easy. However, data for cycling infrastructure appears to be a messiness of complications, stakeholders and data producers. The exemplary lesson is that whatever your research area there are often many views and types of data possible for your research. And the fuller view does not make your research easier, but it does make it better.</description>

Welcome to the third issue of volume 42 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 42:3, 2018).
The IASSIST Quarterly presents in this issue three papers from geographically widespread countries. We call IASSIST &amp;lsquo;International&amp;rsquo;, so I am happy to present papers from three continents in this issue with papers from Zimbabwe, Italy and Canada.
The paper &amp;lsquo;The State of Preparedness for Digital Curation and Preservation: A Case Study of a Developing Country Academic Library&amp;rsquo; is by Phillip Ndhlovu, who works as the institutional repository librarian and liaison librarian, and Thomas Matingwina, who is a lecturer at the Department of Library and Information Service at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.</description>

The IASSIST Quarterly has had several papers on many different aspects of the Data Documentation Initiative - for a long time better known by its acronym DDI, without any further explanation. DDI is a brand. The IASSIST Quarterly has also included special issues of collections of papers concerning DDI.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s notes: Rebuilding, Preserving and Reproducing
Welcome to the first issue of Volume 42 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 42:1, 2018).
The IASSIST Quarterly has a focus on curation, preservation and reproduction of research, and all three bases are covered in this issue. The reproduction of earlier results from archived data is a validation of the data and also of the earlier research. The mimicking reuse of data for reproduction of the original results is the normal first step before use of the data for new purposes.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first issue of Volume 41 of the IASSIST Quarterly. It has taken extra time for this issue to appear. The cause of this is not that we have been extra lazy. The paradoxical cause is that a great many people have been extra busy. Thanks to the team of people in the editorial group of the IASSIST Quarterly and - not least - the great help from Sonya Betz working as Digital Initiatives Projects Librarian at the University of Alberta Libraries in Canada, the IASSIST Quarterly has now moved to the Open Journal System (OJS) at the University of Alberta.</description>

In February I won sponsorship money from IASSIST for a Data Workshop I had in mind. On the 18 November this year I saw my idea come to life. This Data Workshop was aimed at Library student and newgrads and was held in the Ferguson Room of the National Library of Australia. 26 people attended and there were five speakers from industries adjacent to librarianship.</description>

Being international - and proud of it!
IASSIST is proud of being international. These days some us of find it important to emphasize how international collaboration has improved and made our lives more efficient. In the small but around-the-globe-reaching world of IASSIST, many national data archives have come into existence as well as continuing their development, through friendly international support and spreading of knowledge and good practices among IASSISTers.</description>

      <description>The IASSIST Special Interest Group on Data Citation (SIGDC) met in Vancouver on Wednesday, June 1, with 15 people in attendance. The group discussed ways in which IASSIST members could influence data citation standards and behavior. Suggestions were made to:
 Inventory the resources that the SIG maintains and knows about Create a set of simple slides to share with faculty and students; these might include guidelines on citation format with examples but would not endorse a certain format Create posters on data citation to hang in prominent places Contact bibliographic software companies to make sure they include data as a specific resource type Contact style guides &amp;ndash; APA, Chicago, MLA &amp;ndash; to ensure that they are providing appropriate citations for data and including DOIs Create a set of Web pages on this topic on the IASSIST site Contact Google Scholar with a list of issues related to data  Joachim Wackerow presented information on ways to make DOIs more machine-actionable.</description>

      <description>This is a truly fascinating set of events unfurling in Canada. I thought I would add a bit (in too many words) for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t have the pleasure of Canadian media outlets. J
Parliament recently resumed and there have been a number of significant issues, like abolishing the LONG Gun Registry, G8/G20 spending and a new Governor General who happens to be a former University President. Still, the LONG form census continues to make headlines &amp;ndash; do you notice a theme around abolishing programs with the word LONG in them?</description>

      <title>Canadian census - no more long form</title>

      <description>It appears that the Federal Government has decided to no longer have the mandatory long form in the upcoming census (2011). This is the list of detailed questions filled out by about 20% of households. It will be replaced with another voluntary survey. This has many potential implications, especially for those using the census &amp;lsquo;longitudinally&amp;rsquo;. It may have some positive spinoffs, since the replacement has a potentially larger sample size. The disturbing part is that we are not aware of any consultation with the research community.</description>

      <description>In the March 27, 2010 issue of Science News, this article talks about how &amp;ldquo;widespread misuse of statistical methods makes science more like a crapshoot&amp;rdquo;. The problem appears to be based in the misunderstanding and misuse of the concept of statistical significance. The comments at the end of the article make interesting reading, as do those at the end of the Slashdot posting on the same article.</description>

This adds to the momentum already in place at Data.gov to &amp;ldquo;increase public access to high value, machine readable datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.&amp;rdquo; The Open Knowledge Foundation blog describes progress to date and milestones to come.
The UK government also recently announced similar plans to open up data, and the imminent launch of a new Data.</description>

      <description>There was a lot of hype when the new search engine WolframAlpha was launched earlier this year. An article in the current issue of Technology Review does a better job of explaining how it works and how it fits in with other search engines. It notes that the numeric information it uses is &amp;ldquo;curated&amp;rdquo; by Wolfram|Alpha employees &amp;ndash; by which they mean the data are selected and acquired, not just contributed as with sites like Swivel.</description>

      <description>Several weeks ago, Google contacted me at BLS to let us know they were using some of our data in a launch of a new service in data visualization. Their plan is to make as much data available as possible with as rich a tool set as they can provide. To see an example, enter the phrase &amp;ldquo;US Unemployment Rate&amp;rdquo; in the Google search box. The top link sends you to a page that allows you to superimpose historical graphs of unemployment rates down to any county in the US.</description>

      <description>Research Data Strategy Working Group Established http ://cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/media/press/rds_group_e.html, press release, August 12, 2008.
The research process generates huge amounts of data that are an important part of Canada&amp;rsquo;s scholarly record and hold enormous potential as an additional discovery and problem-solving tool for researchers. Unfortunately, Canada has no nationally adopted standards or policies governing how this data is collected, catalogued, or preserved.

      <description>Happy Earth Day to everyone!!
Hope your day is filled with loads of celebratory reducing, renewing, and recycling.
Registration for this year&amp;rsquo;s IASSIST Conference (May 27-30): &amp;ldquo;Technology of Data: Collection, Communication, Access and Preservation&amp;rdquo; is proceeding at a rumbling pace, and the five conference hotels have been filling with eager California-bound IASSISTers.
However, if you still have not made your arrangements for this year&amp;rsquo;s conference, please consider doing so. Early registration ends soon (May 2), and of more immediate concern, the conference hotels will begin dropping our room blocks (and guaranteed conference rates) beginning this Friday, April 25.</description>

Rosling is professor of international health at Sweden&amp;rsquo;s world-renowned Karolinska Institute, and founder of Gapminder, a non-profit that brings vital global data to life.
The video is definitely worth watching! It is interesting technically as a demonstration of data-visualization that is way beyond what we usually see. But it is also interesting because of the content of the data and how Rosling uses data visualization to &amp;ldquo;debunk a few myths about the &amp;lsquo;developing&amp;rsquo; world.</description>

Where are the data? Can I have them? What can I do with them? (17 Dec, 2006).
He takes a practical approach based on the perspective of a researcher. His title says it all.
 &amp;hellip;an Open Data addendum must at least answer my opening questions: it must point to the online, freely accessible location of the raw, un-hamburgered data; it should make clear that yes, you can have them; and it should state clearly what you can do with them.</description>

 In the May 5 memo, VA privacy officer Mark Whitney wrote that the critical data &amp;ldquo;may not be easily accessible&amp;rdquo; because most of it &amp;ndash; including names, birth dates and Social Security numbers &amp;ndash; was stored in a specialized, standard format used for data manipulation and statistical analysis.</description>
