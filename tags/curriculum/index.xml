      <description>The New England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum (NECDMC)Â is an instructional tool for teaching data management best practices to undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers in the health sciences, sciences, and engineering disciplines. Each of the curriculum&amp;rsquo;s seven online instructional modules aligns with the National Science Foundation&amp;rsquo;s data management plan recommendations and addresses universal data management challenges. Included in the curriculum is a collection of actual research cases that provides a discipline specific context to the content of the instructional modules.</description>
