      <description>Lots of conversations going on these days in different venues where people are asking many of the same questions: how do we teach researchers about data management with limited staff, and what data management services should we offer? How do we find sustainable ways to manage data that leverage the efforts of many different repositories, those in government, institutions and disciplinary ones? How do we coalesce standard practice and reasonable but effective policies at at least the national level and preferably on a global scale?</description>

      <description>Freeing African Data Two regional developments have the potential to get African government data into the public domain. Putting their disaggregated data out there can benefit African governance through ensuring transparency and allowing feedback from policy analysis to support better government planning. The World Bank&amp;rsquo;s Central microdata catalog has been around since 2012 and continues to expand its listing of data sources. This is currently the only comprehensive online source for microdata produced by African official data producers, as a listing of country datasets is not available on most African government websites.</description>
