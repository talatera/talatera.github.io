Friends and family have created a scholarship at the University of Michigan-Dearborn in his memory. At the suggestion of the several members and with the approval of the Administrative Committee, IASSIST has contributed $1000 to the scholarship to recognize the numerous contributions Darrell made to the data community right up to the time of his premature passing.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the third issue of volume 43 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 43:3, 2019).
Yes, we are open! Open data is good. Just a click away. Downloadable 24/7 for everybody. An open government would make the decisionmakers&amp;rsquo; data open to the public and the opposition. As an example, communal data on bicycle paths could be open, so more navigation apps would flourish and embed the information in maps, which could suggest more safe bicycle routes.</description>

With joy and pride the many people behind each issue of the IQ are here presenting a special issue. IASSIST has several interest groups of members committed to selected important areas under the umbrella of IASSIST. Be aware that you could become a member of an interest group (see: https://iassistdata.org/about/committees.html#interest). If an interest area that you find important is not presently on this list, you are invited to start campaigning for the formation of a new interest group.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first issue of volume 43 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 43:1, 2019).
The IASSIST Quarterly presents in this issue three papers illustrated in the title above. Chronologically we start from an early beginning. No, not with Turing, we time travel further back and experience ancient Greece. In this submission the Greek drama delivers the form, while data librarians deliver the content on data sharing. And it makes you a proud IASSISTer to know that altruism is the rationale behind data sharing.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the fourth issue of volume 42 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 42:4, 2018).
The IASSIST Quarterly presents in this issue three papers. When you know how, cycling is easy. However, data for cycling infrastructure appears to be a messiness of complications, stakeholders and data producers. The exemplary lesson is that whatever your research area there are often many views and types of data possible for your research. And the fuller view does not make your research easier, but it does make it better.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s notes: Rebuilding, Preserving and Reproducing
Welcome to the first issue of Volume 42 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 42:1, 2018).
The IASSIST Quarterly has a focus on curation, preservation and reproduction of research, and all three bases are covered in this issue. The reproduction of earlier results from archived data is a validation of the data and also of the earlier research. The mimicking reuse of data for reproduction of the original results is the normal first step before use of the data for new purposes.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first issue of Volume 41 of the IASSIST Quarterly. It has taken extra time for this issue to appear. The cause of this is not that we have been extra lazy. The paradoxical cause is that a great many people have been extra busy. Thanks to the team of people in the editorial group of the IASSIST Quarterly and - not least - the great help from Sonya Betz working as Digital Initiatives Projects Librarian at the University of Alberta Libraries in Canada, the IASSIST Quarterly has now moved to the Open Journal System (OJS) at the University of Alberta.</description>

      <description>Spring 2017
Mongolia is large and sparsely populated country, with nomadic traditions, but rapidly modernizing. As in any modern country, there is an important role for data to play in planning and development, and Mongolian data professionals are developing themselves to meet the challenge.
Last year in May 2017, Ryan Womack (currently serving as IASSIST Secretary) was invited to give a two-day workshop on **Topics in Data Science **at the National Statistics Office of Mongolia.</description>

In February I won sponsorship money from IASSIST for a Data Workshop I had in mind. On the 18 November this year I saw my idea come to life. This Data Workshop was aimed at Library student and newgrads and was held in the Ferguson Room of the National Library of Australia. 26 people attended and there were five speakers from industries adjacent to librarianship.</description>

Welcome to the fourth issue of Volume 40 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 40:4, 2016).
There is a lot of management involved in the data management carried out at data archives and with data collections. The phrase &amp;lsquo;Doing the things right and doing the right things&amp;rsquo; belongs to fathers of modern management and is used to distinguish management vs.</description>

      <description>Last week Mandy shared ideas about how librarians and other data-support professionals can act as connectors, crusaders and collaborators on campus in order to better provide and develop qualitative research teaching resources. This week we want to build on Mandy&amp;rsquo;s suggestions by looking a bit more broadly at how librarians and other data-support professionals can help build community around qualitative research at their institutions.
As qualitative research methods are often not the dominant methodologies used in departments and institutions, qualitative researchers may not have a strong support network and may lack colleagues to consult with or learn from.</description>

      <description>Connectors, Crusaders, and Collaborators Jill&amp;rsquo;s post from last week detailed ways we data-support professionals can connect researchers to library collections and other information sources for bridging the qualitative methods gap. I&amp;rsquo;d like to offer more ideas for how we can act not only as connectors but also as crusaders and collaborators on our campuses specifically in the realm of providing and developing qualitative-research teaching resources. Because we work with researchers across campus and in various capacities, data-support professionals are often more aware of methods gaps than are the academic departments we support.</description>

The special issue of the International Journal of Librarianship on Data Librarianship I guest edited has been published. One feature in particular that might be of interest to IASSISTers is an article in which we interviewed a number of people who had prominent and interesting careers in the field and asked them to share their thoughts on how data services have changes over the course of their careers, as well as advice for newbies.</description>

      <description>Mandy kicked off our 4-part blog series last week with an inaugural post that provided background and context for this project, which centers around a specific challenge faced by many qualitative researchers: lack of qualitative methods training. This post offers some concrete ideas to data-support professionals on how to leverage library collections and other information sources that direct researchers to secondary and tertiary sources on qualitative methods to address this issue.</description>

      <description>The IASSIST Qualitative Social Science &amp;amp; Humanities Data Interest Group (QSSHDIG) was created in October 2016, its central purpose: to foster conversations regarding the needs of researchers who generate qualitative data, and what types of services librarians and other information professionals can develop to support these researchers in managing their data/source materials throughout the research lifecycle.
This four-post blog series engages in one particular conversation: challenges researchers face in terms of a lack of qualitative methods training, and strategies for how data-support professionals can address these challenges.</description>

Editor&amp;rsquo;s Notes
Being international - and proud of it!
IASSIST is proud of being international. These days some us of find it important to emphasize how international collaboration has improved and made our lives more efficient. In the small but around-the-globe-reaching world of IASSIST, many national data archives have come into existence as well as continuing their development, through friendly international support and spreading of knowledge and good practices among IASSISTers.</description>

      <description>A version of this post originally appeared on the NYU Data Dispatch blog.
Data rescue efforts began in January 2017, and over the past few months many institutions hosted hack-a-thon style events to scrape data and develop strategies for preservation. The Environmental Data &amp;amp; Governance Initiative (EDGI) developed a data rescue toolkit, which apportioned the challenge of saving data by distinct federal agency. We&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of conversations at NYU and with other members of the library community about the implications of preserving federal data and providing access to it.</description>

We are excited to have new members in IASSIST. IASSIST is a home for data services professionals across many disciplines: librarians, data archivists, open data proponents, data support staff, etc. For some, it is an organization where you don&amp;rsquo;t have to explain what you do because our members already understand. We get metadata, data support, data access issues, database challenges, the challenge of replication and so much more!</description>

This time allowing three students, one each from Switzerland, Korea, and Canada to attend the conference, which titled itself &amp;ldquo;Upstream, Downstream: embedding digital curation workflows for data science, scholarship and society&amp;rdquo;.
Data science was a strong theme of the three keynote presentations, in particular how curation and data management are an active, integrated, ongoing parts of analysis rather than a passive epilogue in research.</description>

http://iassistdata.org/iq/issue/40/2
First, there are two papers on the Data Documentation Initiative that have their own special introduction.

      <description>Jisc held their second Research Data Network event in Cambridge. I went along to take notes.
Danny Kingsley gave an overview of why data sharing is important, which was useful as introduction for those new to this, and a refresher of first principles to the more experienced.
The day then moved into parallel sessions on aspects of the network&amp;rsquo;s activity.
The Research Data Shared Service is an initiative to help intuitions with RDM infrastructure.</description>

      <description>The conference began with a reception from the Mayor of Bergen, beautifully performed Norwegian folk song, and dissent over the conference hashtag (it was #iassist16).
The next morning data talk began with Gudmund Hernes. His plenary theme is data availability or the latest &amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo; is, as it always has, causing a shift in power. The role of IASSISTers and data archives should be to &amp;ldquo;keep the record straight&amp;rdquo;.
UK Data Service Director Matthew Woollard&amp;rsquo;s plenary offered a similar theme of adjustment to a changed data world.</description>

IASSIST was again a sponsor, and presented a poster on IASSIST members&amp;rsquo; activities. In addition, plenty of familiar faces were present including our current IASSIST president and three former ones.
This year&amp;rsquo;s conference was the eleventh IDCC and took the title of &amp;ldquo;Visible data, invisible infrastructure&amp;rdquo;. This asks what can we do to make the hard work of preserving data and making it and keeping it usable as easy as possible for researchers to use and as unobtrusive as possible in their work.</description>

      <description>Late last year, a colleague at Innovations for Poverty Action, Stephanie Wykstra, and I started having conversations about reuse of open data and what we do and don&amp;rsquo;t know about the re-use of existing data sets, particularly which data sets and how they are used. We are also interested in the specific challenges researchers face as they try to re-use data sets collected for other research purposes. Stephanie and I would like to start filling this gap so we are putting out a call for case studies.</description>

These studies describe policies and strategies that pave the way for the creation, institutional integration and the running of support services and underlying infrastructures. In addition, challenges and lessons learned are described, and ways-forward outlined.</description>

I would suggest looking at the twitter feed if you are interested. We had a new member taking sketch notes during the conference, which were quite popular. Also Laurence Horton from LSE took very detailed Google Doc notes and wrote a great blog post.</description>

Data, the whole Data, and nothing but the Data &amp;hellip; and the Metadata, and the Access to Data
Welcome to the third issue of volume 38 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 38:3, 2014). This issue is unquestionably about data. There are three papers on projects for improving delivery of data to users.
The first paper is &amp;lsquo;Distributing Access to Data, not Data&amp;rsquo; by David Schiller from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) at Nuremberg (Germany) and Richard Welpton at UK Data Archive, University of Essex (UK).</description>

UK Data Service&amp;rsquo;s Louise Corti began the day with an overview of their acquisitions process. The Service (under various names) is almost 50 years old that gives it experience and perspective many institutions do not have. Lessons from those years include the importance of a collections development policy that&amp;rsquo;s allowed to evolve. The Archive evaluates on a basis of teaching and re-use for validation and replication.</description>

      <description>On 26/27 February, I attended Jisc Data Spring &amp;ldquo;Sandpit 1&amp;rdquo; in the English city of Birmingham. Data Spring is a funding programme supporting UK based projects in Research Data Management (RDM), and something of a successor to the successful Managing Research Data programmes (MRD) that did so much to get RDM training and tools underway in the UK&amp;rsquo;s education sector.
Unlike the traditional proposal-evaluation-funding model, Data Spring takes a more collaborative, interactive approach, splitting the programme into separate stages at which projects may no longer receive funding.</description>

      <description>The International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC) is now ten years old. On the evidence of its most recent conference, is in rude health and growing fast.
IDCC is the first time IASSIST decided to formally support another organisational conference. I think it was a wise investment given the quality of plenaries, presentations, posters, and discussions.
DCC already has available a number of blogs covering the substance of sessions, including an excellent summary by IASSIST web editor, Robin Rice.</description>

These are my notes, which lack attribution partly because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember where every person was from, and also it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear if the meeting was on or off the record.</description>

Since our last entry, the Data Visualization Working Group (DVIG) has been connecting through email to gather information and share knowledge about data visualization tools, best practices, teaching, and events of interest. A major theme of conversation has been open source programming frameworks like R statistical packages to conduct visualization. Many other non-programming tools have also been discussed and shared. The question of tools is not an easy one, and there are a lot out there!</description>

      <description>Statistical Associates Publishing is a website that offers guides focused primarily on correctly executing various statistical techniques. The guides are short and provide screenshots and step-by-step instructions for for some of the major commercial statistical packages. One can buy the books - each at very low prices $5USD or less per book from Amazon - or request a free copy from the publisher with some reasonable restrictions on use.
I should note that since I don&amp;rsquo;t spend much time doing statistics myself, I feel a bit unqualified to attest to the quality of the materials.</description>

      <description>Lots of conversations going on these days in different venues where people are asking many of the same questions: how do we teach researchers about data management with limited staff, and what data management services should we offer? How do we find sustainable ways to manage data that leverage the efforts of many different repositories, those in government, institutions and disciplinary ones? How do we coalesce standard practice and reasonable but effective policies at at least the national level and preferably on a global scale?</description>

      <description>Freeing African Data Two regional developments have the potential to get African government data into the public domain. Putting their disaggregated data out there can benefit African governance through ensuring transparency and allowing feedback from policy analysis to support better government planning. The World Bank&amp;rsquo;s Central microdata catalog has been around since 2012 and continues to expand its listing of data sources. This is currently the only comprehensive online source for microdata produced by African official data producers, as a listing of country datasets is not available on most African government websites.</description>

      <description>The Thomson-Reuters Data Citation Index (DCI) has been up and running for just over a year. The University of Minnesota (UMN) had a trial of the database when the DCI first launched, but because so little of the database was populated at that time, it was hard to assess it completely. We felt that after a year, it would be worthwhile to revisit it. The initial annual subscrption prices were significant.</description>

&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in the early days of exploring what I and our library can do for our faculty and grad students. In my case I&amp;rsquo;m particularity interested in the social sciences.
It seems there are three main choices:
  ICPSR(or other domain-specific site)
  Dataverse with my own school&amp;rsquo;s branding
  Local, campus funded storage through an Institutional Repository or something else that can handle larger amounts of data.</description>

      <description>Several organizations have begun compiling lists of repositories of research data. These can be useful for researchers both to consider where to deposit their data, as well as for discovery for secondary data use.
DataBib
Tool to identify repositories of research data. Users can search (including field-level searching) or browse by subject or title. Each entry provides a description, standardized subjects, access, start date, and country, among other qualities. Anyone is able to suggest or edit repository listings, which then are reviewed and committed by an editorial board.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just in the process of updating who we follow from our @iassistdata twitter account (we follow members who follow us - when I get round to updating things, sorry).
Given the huge* number of followers we now have, (595, thank you one and all) I thought it would be interesting to see what we looked like according to our twitter bios.
No surprises: we define ourselves as data people or organisations, in terms of &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;librarian&amp;rdquo; (and library related terms), &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;universities&amp;rdquo;.</description>

These questions were on my mind as I was preparing to present a poster at the Open Repositories 2013 conference in Charlottetown, PEI earlier this month. The annual conference brings the digital repositories community together with stakeholders, such as researchers, librarians, publishers and others to address issues pertaining to &amp;ldquo;the entire lifecycle of information.&amp;rdquo; The conference theme this year, &amp;ldquo;Use, Reuse, Reproduce,&amp;rdquo; could not have been more relevant to the ISPS Data Archive.</description>

      <description>Open Repositories 2013 was hosted by the University of Prince Edward Island from July 8-12. A strong research data stream ran throughout this conference, which was attended by over 300 participants from around the globe. To my delight, many IASSISTers were in attendance, including the current IASSIST President and four Past-Presidents! Rarely do such sightings happen outside an IASSIST conference.
  IASSIST Five Presidents by Limor Peer   This was my first Open Repositories conference and after the cool reception that research data received at the SPARC IR meetings in Baltimore a few years ago, I was unsure how data would be treated at this conference.</description>

      <description>From 28-31 May, GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences hosted the 39th Annual Conference of the International Association for Social Science Information Service and Technology, aka #iassist2013
IASSIST conferences provide an overview of what&amp;rsquo;s happening in information technology and data services and allow exchange of ideas between participants working in different backgrounds - from social science and humanities to information and computer science. The aim of this year&amp;rsquo;s event was to help us move closer to the dream of technical and organizational measures that make research data discoverable and accessible.</description>

      <description>I could say this is needed because the videos and wifi weren&amp;rsquo;t working, but in fact I&amp;rsquo;d be asking anyway.
Just think how helpful it is for members who could not be with us (and potential members) to get a snapshot of views about what happened. Serious, silly, short, verbose, objective, or ridiculously opinionated impressions of one session, the social events or overall are very welcome.
Turn your personal notes into a gift that keeps on giving.</description>

 Poderomedia Foundation and PinLatam are launching OpenDataLatinoamerica.org, a regional data repository to free data and use it on Hackathons and other activities by HacksHackers chapters and other organizations.
We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored.</description>

In Australia, the Australian Social Science Data Archive looks to expand, with a Qualitative Data Archive set to open in 2005 at the University of Queensland, and an Administrative Data Archive planned to open that same year at the University of New South Wales.</description>

      <description>Editor notes: Data bring maps, archive brings data, and accreditation brings research
This issue (volume 36-1, 2012) of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ) is the first of the 2012 issues. This editorial is written in March 2013 when many IASSIST people have received acceptance for their papers at the upcoming conference IASSIST 2013 in Cologne. I am certain there will be many interesting presentations at the conference. However, presenters can reach a greater audience by having their paper published in forthcoming issues of the IQ.</description>

      <description>Hey IASSISTers (gents, pardon for the video pun - couldnt&amp;rsquo; resist),
Are librarians at your institutions struggling to get up to speed with research data management (RDM)? If they&amp;rsquo;re not, they probably should be. Library organisations are publishing reports and issuing recommendations left and right, such as the LIBER (Association of European Research Libraries) 2012 report, &amp;ldquo;Ten Recommendations for Libraries to Get Started with Research Data Management&amp;rdquo; (PDF). Just last week Nature published an article highlighting what the Great and the Good are doing in this area: Publishing Frontiers: The Library Reboot.</description>

      <description>These days many IASSIST members have received acceptance for their papers to the upcoming conference IASSIST 2013 in Cologne. There will be many interesting presentations at the conference. The conference presentation is your chance to present a project you are involved in, to air your argumentation for special areas, and in general to add to the IASSIST knowledge bank.
Projects are typically focused on support of social science research but the IASSIST related support now takes many forms with the developments of technology and applications.</description>

      <description>Hello fellow IASSISTer&amp;rsquo;s
 With the upcoming 2013 Conference nearing, we thought it very fitting to introduce you all to the newly created IASSIST Data Visualization Interest Group. Formed over the winter and now spring of 2013, this group brings together over 46 IASSIST members from across the world (literally across-the-world! check out the map of our locations), who are all interested in data visualization. We hope to share a range of skills and information around tools, best practice visualization, and discuss innovative representations of data, statistics, and information.</description>

      <description>Some reflections on research data confidentiality, privacy, and curation
Limor Peer
Maintaining research subjects&amp;rsquo; confidentiality is an essential feature of the scientific research enterprise. It also presents special challenges to the data curation process. Does the effort to open access to research data complicate these challenges?
A few reasons why I think it does: More data are discoverable and could be used to re-identify previously de-identified datasets; systems are increasingly interoperable, potentially bridging what may have been insular academic data with other data and information sources; growing pressure to open data may weaken some of the safeguards previously put in place; and some data are inherently identifiable.</description>

      <guid>https://www.iassistdata.org/blog/2013/03/05/search-best-practice-code-repositories/</guid>
      <description>I was asked by a colleague about organized efforts within the economics community to develop or support repositories of code for research. Her experience was with the astrophysics world which apparently has several and she was wondering what could be learned from another academic community. So I asked a non-random sample of technical economists with whom I work, and then expanded the question to cover all of social sciences and posed the question to the IASSIST community.</description>

      <description>About a month ago I put some initial reactions to the Thomson Reuters Data Citation Index into a public note. I received some requests to do a more formal version of the same and have finally been able to do so at http://z.umn.edu/trdci. It&amp;rsquo;s a Google Doc that should be public and should allow comments.
Our trial period ended in early December and it may be that some of the problems I describe have since been resolved.</description>

      <description>[]{.image-right}I &amp;lsquo;d been meaning to write an IASSIST blog post about OR 2012, hosted by the University of Edinburgh&amp;rsquo;s Host Organising Committee led by Co-Chair and IASSISTer Stuart Macdonald in July, because it had such good DATA content.
Fortunately Simon Hodson, the UK&amp;rsquo;s JISC Managing Research Data Programme Manager, has provided this introduction and has allowed me to post it here, with further links to his analytic blog posts, and even those contain further links to OTHER blog posts talking about OR2012 and data!</description>

      <description>One of the highlights of the after hours hanging out during IASSIST conferences is getting to play some pool and make geeky data jokes you don&amp;rsquo;t have to explain to anyone. For you pool-playing enthusiasts, I sharethis YouTube of a potential future IASSIST conference goer .. (note, none of us can play anywhere near the level of this 5 yr old.) Happy Weekend everyone! </description>

      <description>Reposted from the RStudio Blog:
Welcome Hadley, Winston, and Garrett!
August 20, 2012 in News
RStudio&amp;rsquo;s mission from the beginning has been to create powerful tools that support the practices and techniques required for creating trustworthy, high quality analysis. For many years Hadley Wickham has been teaching and working on his own set of tools for R with many of the same core goals. We&amp;rsquo;ve been collaborating quite a bit with Hadley over the past couple of years and today we&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce that Hadley, Winston Chang, and Garrett Grolemund are joining RStudio so we can continue to work together much more closely.</description>

      <description>Great work by Richard Ball, an Economics professor at Haverford College and Norm Medeiros, a Haverford librarian. I&amp;rsquo;m already planning to incorporate their protocol into my formal and informal data literacy instruction. I highly recommend a visit to their website: Teaching integrity in empirical research: a soup to nuts protocol
They&amp;rsquo;ve also published a paper on their work. Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:
 This article describes a protocol the authors developed for teaching undergraduates to document their statistical analyses for empirical research projects so that their results are completely reproducible and verifiable.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Lynda Kellam at the Dataland Blog for highlighting the United States Department of Housing &amp;amp; Urban Development (HUD) Data Set Reference Guides. HUD has a dense website and posts a lot of data. These two tables help you figure out which ones are most relevant for which areas of research. Unfortunately, neither has a usefully descriptive name or clear pattern of inclusion. The second guide is much shorter and includes sets like the CBO Appropriations and Fair Housing Cases as opposed to the American Housing Survey and State of the Cities listed on the first guide.</description>

      <description>The IASSIST Special Interest Group on Data Citation (SIGDC) met in Vancouver on Wednesday, June 1, with 15 people in attendance. The group discussed ways in which IASSIST members could influence data citation standards and behavior. Suggestions were made to:
 Inventory the resources that the SIG maintains and knows about Create a set of simple slides to share with faculty and students; these might include guidelines on citation format with examples but would not endorse a certain format Create posters on data citation to hang in prominent places Contact bibliographic software companies to make sure they include data as a specific resource type Contact style guides &amp;ndash; APA, Chicago, MLA &amp;ndash; to ensure that they are providing appropriate citations for data and including DOIs Create a set of Web pages on this topic on the IASSIST site Contact Google Scholar with a list of issues related to data  Joachim Wackerow presented information on ways to make DOIs more machine-actionable.</description>

CENSUS : 2006 is a Census year and the day I am writing this is actually Census Day &amp;ndash; the day we are all supposed to fill in our Census. In Canada it is against the law to not do this and of course all Canadians are law abiding (apparently only 5 people were convicted in 2001). So guess what &amp;ndash; I just filled out my Census and I filled it out on-line!</description>

I am going to keep this years report short and focus on a few significant initiatives that are going to set a direction in Canada over the next few years.
DDI - There are 4 significant projects around DDI that are coming together. In November at a DINO meeting at Ryerson University we had the opportunity to hear about all these initiatives and see how they interrelate and can build on each other.</description>

Cross European Collaborations | National Reports
This report begins with some observations on cross-national collaborations, after which will be country-by-country reports of national/institutional/individual activities. I have only included reports for those people/organisations/countries/projects from whom I have received information.
All in all, seems that the Europeans (at least in the field of data archiving) have had their share of organisational changes.</description>

Susan Herbst, incoming President at the University of Connecticut: What about UConn drew you here?
&amp;ldquo;There are many aspects of UConn that attracted me, but the primary one is the spirit of the institution. Growing up in the Northeast, I knew many people who attended UConn and held a deep, abiding love of the University.</description>

      <description>Great News Everyone! The Government of Canada has just debuted a new portal to their data at the Open Data Pilot Project. The pilot has launched with 782 general datasets (e.g. not geospatial) and over 260,000 geospatial datasets. The three agencies contributing the largest number of datasets as of launch are Department of Finance Canada (258), Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (226), and Statistics Canada (120). The data gathered here is freely available to all users and comes with an apparently very broad user license.</description>

      <description>I wanted to share a blog post from our local Data and GIS blog that may be of interest to the IASSIST community. Each of the tools varies in it&amp;rsquo;s focus and applicability for data work- but they might be helpful for various data tasks focusing on cleaning and representing data online.

On a slightly related note, I was very impressed with the CAR (Computer Assisted Reporting) Conference and the IRE (Investigative Reporters and Editors Group).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Data are larger than the social sciences&amp;rdquo; and data concerns have grown beyond the traditional communities comprising IASSIST.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;respondent to strategic plan survey (2009)
As preparations intensify for IASSIST 2011, I encourage IASSIST members to review the 2010-2014 Strategic Plan with its focus on Advocacy, Community, and Professional Development.
As IASSIST moves into the second year of the plan, the organization finds itself in an environment where data concerns have expanded to the point that many organizations have placed data curation, data sharing, and developing data literacy at the forefront of their agenda.</description>

Important! We encourage you to book as soon as possible, even before you have permission from your institution (you can always cancel if it turns out you can&amp;rsquo;t attend).</description>

      <description>The IASSIST Quarterly (IQ) volume 33 number 3 is now on the web:
[http://iassistdata.org/iq/issue/33/3]
With this issue concentrating on quantitative investigations and the use of statistics, I came to think of the Mark Twain citation &amp;ldquo;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&amp;rdquo; With the violent title of the first article (see below), the article on numbers and statistics, and the report from a national statistics agency, the &amp;ldquo;Torture,Numbers, and Digital Tape&amp;rdquo; title surfaced.</description>

      <description>After our annual conferences, members often want to continue conversations with IASSIST colleagues on topics of professional interest. Your Administrative Committee has responded by creating the Interest Group Development Action Group. Its charge is to identify and help form interest groups so members can continue those conversations.
An interest group is a great way to share information on a topic of mutual interest, learn more about it, and share that knowledge with the larger IASSIST membership.</description>

      <description>What is an IASSIST interest group? At its most basic, it&amp;rsquo;s composed of at least 4 members plus a coordinator. They want to know more about a topic of professional interest and share what they know and learn with the larger IASSIST membership. The larger the interest group, the greater they synergy! Interest groups are also a good way to stay connected to other members if you can&amp;rsquo;t attend the annual conferences very often.</description>

Inauguration of a new administration brings substantial changes in the executive branch. As preparation for the decennial Census intensifies, there&amp;rsquo;s been scrutiny of the President&amp;rsquo;s choice(s) for Commerce Secretary as well as his Census Bureau nominee, Robert Groves. Both Secretary Gary Locke and Groves (director of the Survey Research Institute, University of Michigan) addressed concerns of some in Congress; that is, the latter&amp;rsquo;s past support for statistical sampling in the decennial Census.</description>

National Statistical Agencies Events at the U.S. Census Bureau generated quite a stir, the most important one being the resignation of Director Charles Kincannon and Deputy Director Hermann Habermann in November 2006. Mr. Kincannon cited &amp;ldquo;shifting priorities&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;changing family responsibilities&amp;rdquo; as his reasons for stepping down, although he continues as Director pending nomination and confirmation of his replacement.</description>

Parliament recently resumed and there have been a number of significant issues, like abolishing the LONG Gun Registry, G8/G20 spending and a new Governor General who happens to be a former University President. Still, the LONG form census continues to make headlines &amp;ndash; do you notice a theme around abolishing programs with the word LONG in them?</description>

      <description>The National Center for Education Statistics&amp;rsquo; (NCES) Datalab, introduced earlier this year by the United States Department of Education, provides a user-friendly entry to NCES data. The home page, linked above, links to
 QuickStats for users of summary data needing quick tables or charts (requires click-through agreement to terms of use) PowerStats for users of microdata needing to run linear and logistic regressions (requires free user registration) Library for users looking for prepared summary tables Links to the Restricted-Use Data Procedures Manual  NCES also promises to soon make available tables already created via the QuickStats and PowerStats tools which would be potentially the most powerful aspect of the Datalab.</description>

      <description>It appears that the Federal Government has decided to no longer have the mandatory long form in the upcoming census (2011). This is the list of detailed questions filled out by about 20% of households. It will be replaced with another voluntary survey. This has many potential implications, especially for those using the census &amp;lsquo;longitudinally&amp;rsquo;. It may have some positive spinoffs, since the replacement has a potentially larger sample size. The disturbing part is that we are not aware of any consultation with the research community.</description>

      <description>In the March 27, 2010 issue of Science News, this article talks about how &amp;ldquo;widespread misuse of statistical methods makes science more like a crapshoot&amp;rdquo;. The problem appears to be based in the misunderstanding and misuse of the concept of statistical significance. The comments at the end of the article make interesting reading, as do those at the end of the Slashdot posting on the same article.</description>

      <description>There was a lot of hype when the new search engine WolframAlpha was launched earlier this year. An article in the current issue of Technology Review does a better job of explaining how it works and how it fits in with other search engines. It notes that the numeric information it uses is &amp;ldquo;curated&amp;rdquo; by Wolfram|Alpha employees &amp;ndash; by which they mean the data are selected and acquired, not just contributed as with sites like Swivel.</description>

      <description>A week has passed since IASSIST 2009. I hope most of you have made it safely back home by now - and are ready to refresh the memories by watching the conference webcasts and viewing presentations. Webcasts of all three plenaries and Thursday and Friday&amp;rsquo;s concurrent sessions in the Small Auditorium are now available. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have cameras available during the Wednesday sessions, so no videos of these presentations, sorry! But most of the presentations are already online - a few are still missing either because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have them or we are waiting for an updated version.</description>

      <description>Several weeks ago, Google contacted me at BLS to let us know they were using some of our data in a launch of a new service in data visualization. Their plan is to make as much data available as possible with as rich a tool set as they can provide. To see an example, enter the phrase &amp;ldquo;US Unemployment Rate&amp;rdquo; in the Google search box. The top link sends you to a page that allows you to superimpose historical graphs of unemployment rates down to any county in the US.</description>

      <description>In 2006, motivated by the OECD Open Access guidelines, the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD) carried out an online survey targeting professors of human sciences, social sciences and behavioural sciences in Finnish universities. Professors were asked, for example, whether their department had any guidelines on the preservation of digital research data. A great and alarming majority (90%) said no. The survey also charted what actually happens to research data and what are the barriers to and benefits of open access to research data.</description>

The research process generates huge amounts of data that are an important part of Canada&amp;rsquo;s scholarly record and hold enormous potential as an additional discovery and problem-solving tool for researchers. Unfortunately, Canada has no nationally adopted standards or policies governing how this data is collected, catalogued, or preserved.

Welcome to the first issue of the IASSIST Quarterly, vol. 31. We have passed the 34th IASSIST conference, also known as the Stanford IASSIST 2008 conference - best ever. However, the IASSIST Quarterly vol. 31 is known also as the 2007 volume. Yes, we are behind our schedule; but at least we are consistently so.</description>

      <description>Regardless of the institutional setting in which we work, more and more of us are having to address researcher access to restricted or confidential datasets. This post focuses on sessions at Stanford that covered this important topic&amp;ndash;or rather, group of topics because there are so many intersecting responsibilities to actually making such access a reality for our users.

 Sensors everywhere. Infinite storage. Clouds of processors. Our ability to capture, warehouse, and understand massive amounts of data is changing science, medicine, business, and technology.

I allocated too few moments to visiting the poster sessions. One that intrigued me was the Digital Library Federation&amp;rsquo;s American Social History Online project, or Aquifer. (Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that I was a history major.</description>

      <description>And another conference has passed. It&amp;rsquo;s so sad to think that it will be another year before we get together again but at least we can play virtually on our lists, this blog and maybe even in SecondLife! I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to round up more conference reports but in the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s the official conference song lyrics. Sing to the tune of The Band&amp;rsquo;s song &amp;ldquo;The Weight&amp;rdquo;
In case the tune doesn&amp;rsquo;t come to mind immediately, here&amp;rsquo;s a clip on YouTube from the movie &amp;ldquo;The Last Waltz&amp;rdquo;.</description>

 what will they say when I tell them about SusieQue!  [](http://iassistblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/iassistsl_small.wmf) As a technology-oriented association hosting a technology-themed conference, it is maybe not surprising that we should experiment a bit.</description>

      <description>Happy Earth Day to everyone!!
Hope your day is filled with loads of celebratory reducing, renewing, and recycling.
Registration for this year&amp;rsquo;s IASSIST Conference (May 27-30): &amp;ldquo;Technology of Data: Collection, Communication, Access and Preservation&amp;rdquo; is proceeding at a rumbling pace, and the five conference hotels have been filling with eager California-bound IASSISTers.
However, if you still have not made your arrangements for this year&amp;rsquo;s conference, please consider doing so. Early registration ends soon (May 2), and of more immediate concern, the conference hotels will begin dropping our room blocks (and guaranteed conference rates) beginning this Friday, April 25.</description>

      <description>First, on January 18th, an announcement was made on blog.wired.comthat Google will be hosting terabytes of science data.
 Sources at Google have disclosed that the humble domain, http://research.google.com , will soon provide a home for terabytes of open-source scientific datasets. The storage will be free to scientists and access to the data will be free for all. The project, known as Palimpsest and first previewed to the scientific community at the Science Foo camp at the Googleplex last August, missed its original launch date this week, but will debut soon.</description>

      <description>For those tech-types who do their own data munging, here&amp;rsquo;s a rant from Mark Dominus, a Perl programming wizard who was briefly stymied by trying to process a large data file from Census. As we face these issues daily in my office, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share the frustration!
Of course, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention where he thinks metadata &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; go but I have a pretty good idea what he would suggest&amp;hellip;. ;-)</description>

The Pullman House History Project is a part of the Pullman State Historic Site&amp;rsquo;s virtual museum and web site (http://www.pullman-museum.org/) which links together census, city directory, and telephone directory information to describe the people who lived in the town of Pullman, Illinois between 1881 and 1940. This demographic data is linked through a database/XML record system to online maps and Perl programs that allow the data to be represented in various useful combinations.</description>

      <description>Jim sent me a message earlier today about a new data visualisation website that he had discovered: StatCrunch. When I took a look at this site, I encountered an appeal for people to upload and share their data, which struck a familiar chord. It seems that all of these web-based visualisation tools make a similar appeal. This certainly is true of Swivel, Data360 and Many Eyes.
Thinking back to an earlier era, statistical package vendors always included some data with their software.</description>

      <description>As part of the JISC-funded DISC-UK DataShare project{.moz-txt-link-freetext} in the UK, a State-of-the-Art Review has been written, marking out the current scene on data sharing at the beginning of the project. While the report is UK-focused, it may be of wider interest, and has a very thorough bibliography.
DISC-UK is a UK consortium of data support professionals working in departments and academic libraries in universities (Data Information Specialists Committee-United Kingdom). The project is about DISC-UK members (all of whom are also IASSIST members) working with academics and institutional repository managers at the four partner institutions - London School of Economics and the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Southampton - to provide exemplars for sharing research data within institutional repositories (based on EPrints.</description>

In Canada, census releases are no dreary catalogue of numbers. They spark debate and fuel conversation about the country. Statistics Canada has released the results of the 2006 census on marital status, families and housing, and we&amp;rsquo;re at it again. So important is the census that we debate not only its findings, but also access to its content.</description>

I found the screencast, Crime in New Hampshire: Exploring the data, interesting for several reasons:
It is a good example of data availability (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this because I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to investigate a perceived crime wave in my home town.</description>

Thank heavens the session was moved to a neighboring room&amp;mdash;larger and with a microphone. Obviously, a popular session on the challenges of working with data agreements from the perspectives of acquisition and user support.</description>

      <description>So now that I remember my blog password, I have lots to say. I want to extend my congratulations and kudos to my fellow session participants in C3 (New Discovery Tools: Thinking Outside the Catalogue) where we managed to kill 3 laptops and still do 4 outstanding presentations. The room was too hot and too crowded but the attendees were patient, enthusiastic and even provided some tech support!!
Paul Bern was the lucky presenter - the laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t reallly crash until he was done explaining how to make Google work better for us and help us to help other folks find data.</description>

      <description>An overriding theme of the A1 session, Self-Archiving or Self Storage, was empowering data producers to participate in creating and providing metadata for their materials. Another way to describe it: involving researchers in these processes by meeting them where they&amp;rsquo;re at with the most flexible tools possible. I must also mention that this was an extremely popular session, drawing a standing-room-only crowd. So this roving blogger found a comfy seat in the back of the room on the floor, next to the fake potted palm.</description>

      <description>The RIN (Research Information Network) has recently published a draft consultation paper - Stewardship of digital research data: a framework of principles and guidelines (April 2007) and are seeking feedback from practitioners.
The draft discusses the shared framework of principles and guidelines required for key stakeholders (researchers, research institutions, funding bodies, libraries, data managers, learned societies and publishers) in order to maximise the potential benefits of digital research data and to help ensure that &amp;lsquo;ideas and knowledge derived from publicly-funded research should be made available and accessible for public use, interrogation, and scrutiny, as widely, rapidly and effectively as practicable.</description>

      <description>IBM has announced Many Eyes, a site for sharing and commenting on visualizations.
 As with swivel, users can upload any data set, but the tools for visualizing and graphing the data are much richer. The visualization options include US and World maps, line graphs, stack graphs, bar charts, block histograms, bubble diagrams, scatter plots, network diagrams, pie charts, and treemaps. The site isn&amp;rsquo;t yet live, but should be very shortly.</description>

      <description>At Gapminder there is a link to a video of Hans Rosling&amp;rsquo;s TED Talk Recorded February, 2006 in Monterey, CA. Rosling is professor of international health at Sweden&amp;rsquo;s world-renowned Karolinska Institute, and founder of Gapminder, a non-profit that brings vital global data to life.
The video is definitely worth watching! It is interesting technically as a demonstration of data-visualization that is way beyond what we usually see. But it is also interesting because of the content of the data and how Rosling uses data visualization to &amp;ldquo;debunk a few myths about the &amp;lsquo;developing&amp;rsquo; world.</description>

      <description>Bill Hooker has written a nice article about ensuring that the data behind published scientific literature are made openly available.
Where are the data? Can I have them? What can I do with them? (17 Dec, 2006).
He takes a practical approach based on the perspective of a researcher. His title says it all.
 &amp;hellip;an Open Data addendum must at least answer my opening questions: it must point to the online, freely accessible location of the raw, un-hamburgered data; it should make clear that yes, you can have them; and it should state clearly what you can do with them.</description>

This week Peter Murray-Rust, who spearheads the SPARC-Opendata discussion list, posted a message announcing his entry for Open Data in the Wikipedia and inviting others to contribute to this entry.
Robin Rice responded to Peter&amp;rsquo;s message with a copy of the IASSIST call for papers, which resulted in the following obervation from Peter: &amp;ldquo;Many of [the topics in the call for papers] have a close overlap with the topics at the Science Commons meeting and it is clear that Open Data is likely to become more widely used.</description>

      <description>Google has announced a new service, that might make it possible for the data community to collaborate to build a customized data-finder. The service is the Google Custom Search Engine (CSE).
Similar in some ways to Rollyo, a service that has been around for some time, the Google CSE has several nice features:
 Limit results of a Google search to specific sites. Exclude sites from search results. Collaborate on the selection of the sites to search and exclude Customize the search results page Add &amp;ldquo;refinements&amp;rdquo; that make it easy for users to refine search results Eliminate Google ads if hosted by a university, government agency, or non-profit  There is a story about the service on eWeek: Google Copies Rollyo&amp;rsquo;s Business Plan, Inserts AdSense (October 24, 2006 4:01 AM) by Steve Bryant.</description>

Although the focus was on e-science more than social science, the questions and answers might be of interest. All the questions and answers are available here. D.

      <description>The Chronicle of Higher Education is sponsoring an online discussion on Thursday, June 22 on the topic of preserving data.
 The Chronicle: Colloquy: Data Deluge
 Thanks to digital technology, scientists are generating vast amounts of valuable data that, months later, may be irretrievable or indecipherable. Librarians are being called in to archive that information, but financial, technical, and even cultural barriers stand in the way. Who should pay for archiving digital data?</description>

      <description>Recently I posted a message to the IASSIST mailing list about a study in in the ICPSR Publication Related Archive that had a data file in an old (SST) statistical software format. I had no tools to convert or even read that file and was looking for a solution to get the data. I solved that problem through the kindness of the software producer who converted the file for me.</description>

      <description>The Washington Post reports that the personal information recently stolen from the VA &amp;ldquo;was stored in a format that could make it difficult for thieves to use, according to an internal VA memo.&amp;rdquo;
 In the May 5 memo, VA privacy officer Mark Whitney wrote that the critical data &amp;ldquo;may not be easily accessible&amp;rdquo; because most of it &amp;ndash; including names, birth dates and Social Security numbers &amp;ndash; was stored in a specialized, standard format used for data manipulation and statistical analysis.</description>

      <description>Tiffani Conner, Paula Lackie and Jen Darragh are working on the handouts for an ALA poster session and have found that defining &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;data librarian&amp;rdquo; clearly, in a concise manner, for a non-data audience is really hard. In addition, some of the sources they consulted (the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science - ODLIS , Oxford English Dictionary ) were not adequate (ODLIS has data, data set, social science data set but the definitions are not that great).</description>

      <description>The Digital Life Cycle was mentioned many times during the IASSIST 2006 conference. Reaction toward this concept was varied. Some were unsure they liked this idea claiming that the life cycle was a confusing or imperfect metaphor. Others applied a very exact meaning to the concept associating it to the stages through which information passes within a system or large process. The Session that I chaired on Institutional Repositories and Social Science Data: Supporting the Data Life Cycle (B1) provided different visual representations of the digital life cycle.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 2006 IASSIST Conference in Ann Arbor! For those who can&amp;rsquo;t join in the fun, we (the Pubs committee and the Admin Committee) have decided it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for us to blog the conference! (See San&amp;rsquo;s fine example below.) Use this post to comment with your thoughts on a session that really got you thinking.

      <description>I will start with a disclaimer that I am not a metadata expert nor do I play one on TV but I have been spending a lot of time recently contemplating metadata issues. Granted they have been issues that deal with metadata in a time series world but it gave me an interesting frame of reference for attending several sessions on metadata-related issues. Here&amp;rsquo;s my thoughts:
After attending three and a half session exploring metadata issues, the one clear idea that has emerged is that there don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be any clear ideas.</description>

      <description>Edmonton Journal technology columnist Steve Makris wrote about recent developments in data mining that could have potential implications for providing access to confidential social survey data (see &amp;ldquo;Hot Data,&amp;rdquo; Edmonton Journal, Business, G1, May 17, 2006.) Makris mentioned some major companies raiding each other&amp;rsquo;s data mining experts, such as Google hiring Kai-Fu Lee away from Microsoft only to see Microsoft swoop up Rakesh Agrawal from IBM. Can these companies capitalize on the massive data accumulated by private companies and governments through data mining technology?</description>

      <description>I am writing to address an issue that is coming up at UCLA with increasing frequency. More and more data distributors (agencies, archives, individuals) require a user to &amp;ldquo;register&amp;rdquo; before downloading data from a web site. These registrations take many forms and there is a continuum in terms of levels of detail and responsibility assigned to the user. It makes it hard for me to be of service to users when each study requires every individual to perform the registration task.</description>

      <description>Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner provides an economist&amp;rsquo;s analysis of some social issues not normally associated with economics, such as, the causes of crime, the impact of parenting on child development, and the power of information in combating racial discrimination. This review identifies four common themes running throughout the book and offers a critical assessment of the strenghts and weaknesses of this book from one data librarian&amp;rsquo;s perspective.Following the suggestion of two IASSIST friends, I added Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven Levitt and Stephan Dubner to my vacation reading list, although I must admit that this was the only non-mystery that I read this summer.</description>

Three IASSIST members were the contributing authors on Wednesday, June 22nd, which had a focus on access to data. Alastair Allan wrote about e-government information and its challenges; Robin Rice addressed issues of access and the uses of open access publishing and digital repositories; and Melanie Wright described the many changes in delivering data using the Internet and this impact on data services.</description>

      <description>The final report of the Canadian National Consultation on Access to Scientific Research Data has just been released containing eighteen recommendations to improve open access to research data in Canada. While some of these recommendations are unique to the Canadian context, others share a close relationship with the recommendations of the International Council for Science report, Scientific Data and Information. Supported by the National Research Council of Canada, a task force was established in June 2004 to provide advice about improving access to scientific research data.</description>

      <description>Two sessions at the Edinburgh conference helped formulate in my mind some concerns that I have about the future of data archives. Together, the plenary session in which John Curtice described his research about postmodern values and Session G3 on Transforming Data Archives unified for me (i) ideas about anti-institutional values expressed in postmodernism and (ii) current organizational threats to data archives.
I have been troubled by the struggles we have confronted in Canada to establish a national institution to preserve data.</description>
